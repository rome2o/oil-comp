Excellent. As a B2B industrial SEO strategist, I will analyze this portfolio for HBNO. My analysis will focus on identifying the core strategic disconnect and providing actionable recommendations to align their SEO efforts with B2B objectives.

Executive Summary¶The current keyword portfolio for HBNO reveals a significant strategic misalignment. While the company operates in the oil industry with a clear B2B component (hbnobulk.com), its organic traffic is overwhelmingly driven by top-of-funnel, B2C, informational keywords related to personal wellness, home remedies, and pet care.
The portfolio is healthy for a consumer blog but unhealthy for a B2B industrial supplier. The company is successfully attracting a B2C audience with "how-to" and "benefits" content but is failing to capture high-value B2B traffic from prospects seeking bulk suppliers, wholesale pricing, or industrial applications. The low branded traffic percentage (5.92%) is a symptom of this B2C focus, indicating low brand recall among their target industrial audience.
The immediate priority is to defend and optimize existing B2C traffic while aggressively building a separate, dedicated B2B keyword strategy for hbnobulk.com.

Detailed Keyword Analysis¶1. Keyword Portfolio Health¶
Quality: High for a B2C blog, poor for a B2B supplier. The portfolio is dominated by long-tail informational queries (e.g., how to dilute tea tree oil for dogs). While these queries generate traffic, they attract individuals, not procurement managers or formulators.
Diversity: The portfolio lacks intent diversity. It is saturated with informational queries ("benefits of," "side effects of," "vs"). There is a severe deficiency in keywords with commercial and transactional intent, especially within a B2B context (e.g., "supplier," "wholesale," "bulk").
Relevance: The portfolio is relevant to the products they sell (oils) but not to the B2B business model. It answers questions from end-users, not from businesses that would purchase in bulk. The presence of non-English keywords (बालों में सरसों का तेल लगाने के नुकसान) suggests an untargeted international reach that may not align with business goals.

2. Branded vs. Non-Branded Balance¶The branded traffic percentage of 5.92% is concerningly low.

Interpretation: This is not a healthy balance. While a low reliance on branded traffic can mean strong non-brand reach, in this B2B context, it signals weak brand awareness and authority in the industrial space. B2B buyers often search for trusted supplier names directly. The low volume for "hbno" (450/month) supports this.
Conclusion: HBNO is not currently a go-to name that industrial buyers are searching for. The SEO strategy has built topical authority in "wellness oils," not brand authority as an "industrial oil supplier."

3. Intent Analysis¶The intent mix is dangerously skewed:

Informational (90%+): The vast majority of top keywords are questions (how to, can dogs have, does neem oil). This attracts an audience seeking knowledge, not products to purchase in bulk.
Commercial (5-10%): A few keywords like best body oil for dry skin and cheapest carrier oil show commercial investigation, but again, from a consumer perspective.
Transactional ( <1%): The portfolio shows almost no traffic from users with an intent to purchase, especially in bulk. The only keyword flagged as transactional (hbno essential oils) is also branded.
Navigational (Branded Only): Limited to the "hbno" brand term itself.

This profile indicates they are succeeding at the top of the B2C funnel but have no effective B2B funnel built through SEO.
4. Quick Win Opportunities (Positions 4-10)¶These keywords have high volume and are on the verge of page 1, top 3 visibility. Pushing them higher can yield significant traffic gains.

fall essential oil blends (Pos 9, Vol 4600): Highest Priority. This is a huge opportunity. Optimize by:
Updating the article for the current year (e.g., "Top Fall Blends for 2024").
Adding a video or high-quality infographics.
Improving internal linking from the post to individual oil product pages (Cinnamon, Clove, Orange, etc.).

helichrysum benefits (Pos 9, Vol 3300): Similar terms (helichrysum oil benefits, helichrysum essential oil benefits) are also at position 9. Consolidate or internally link these pages. Update with scientific sources and add clear CTAs to the product page.
best body oil for dry skin (Pos 6, Vol 1300): This is a key commercial term. Optimize by:
Creating a comparison table of different oils (Jojoba, Argan, Coconut).
Adding user-generated content like reviews or testimonials.
Ensuring the page is clearly structured to answer the "best" query and links directly to purchasing options.

neem oil for dogs (Pos 10, Vol 1400): Very high volume. Improve by adding expert quotes (from veterinarians, if possible), clarifying safety guidelines, and creating a clearer user experience on the page.

5. Content Gaps (The B2B Void)¶The most significant gap is the near-total absence of B2B keywords. HBNO is missing the entire industrial buyer journey.
Missed Keyword Categories:

Supplier/Wholesale: bulk essential oil suppliers, wholesale castor oil, peppermint oil manufacturer usa
Industrial Applications: carrier oils for cosmetic formulation, essential oils for candle making bulk, neem oil for organic agriculture
Logistics & Sourcing: 55 gallon drum jojoba oil price, essential oil private labeling, fair trade shea butter supplier
Technical/Spec-driven: tea tree oil certificate of analysis, lavender oil msds, eucalyptus globulus spec sheet

These keywords have lower volume but carry exponentially higher commercial value and relevance for hbnobulk.com.
6. Competitive Vulnerability¶High-traffic keywords in positions 5-10 are highly vulnerable to competitors.

At-Risk Keywords: fall essential oil blends (Pos 9), helichrysum benefits (Pos 9), is tea tree oil safe for cats (Pos 9), neem oil for dogs (Pos 10).
The Threat: A competitor (e.g., Plant Therapy, doTERRA, or another bulk supplier) could create a more comprehensive "10 Best Fall Blends" guide and easily push HBNO off page one, wiping out that traffic. Because the authority is built on B2C topics, a more established B2C wellness blog could also easily outrank them.

7. Long-tail Strategy¶HBNO is already executing an effective informational long-tail strategy. However, they need to pivot.
Recommendation: Continue the current strategy for B2C traffic defense but launch a new, parallel commercial B2B long-tail strategy. This involves targeting highly specific queries that indicate a buyer is ready to make a large purchase.

Examples: where to buy bulk organic argan oil for cosmetics, best wholesale price for frankincense oil, private label essential oil starter kits for small business.

Recommendations & Action Plan¶Immediate Action Items (Next 30-60 Days)¶
Optimize "Quick Win" Pages: Immediately implement the optimization tactics listed in #4 for keywords like fall essential oil blends and best body oil for dry skin to secure and increase existing traffic streams.
Add B2B Cross-Promotional CTAs: On the top 10 B2C traffic-driving blog posts, add clear, visible banners and in-text calls-to-action: "Need this in bulk for your business? Visit hbnobulk.com for wholesale pricing." This is the fastest way to bridge the gap and funnel existing traffic.
Strengthen Commercial Intent on B2C Pages: Revise the top 20 informational pages to include stronger bottom-of-funnel elements. Add product carousels, comparison tables, and direct "Shop Now" links to convert more of the existing traffic.

Strategic Recommendations (Next 6-12 Months)¶
Launch a Dedicated B2B Keyword Strategy & Content Plan: This is the highest priority. Perform comprehensive keyword research for hbnobulk.com focusing on the "Content Gap" areas identified in #5 (supplier, wholesale, application, technical).
Create B2B "Industry Hub" Content: Develop content hubs on hbnobulk.com targeting specific industrial verticals. Examples: "A Guide to Carrier Oils for Skincare Formulation," "Essential Oils in Commercial Soap Making," "Technical Specs for Aromatherapy Practitioners."
Build B2B Authority with Link Building: Launch a link-building campaign for hbnobulk.com targeting trade publications, manufacturing directories, and cosmetic science websites. This will build relevance and authority in the B2B space, separate from the B2C blog.
Differentiate the Blogs: Ensure the hbno.com blog remains focused on B2C topics while creating a new, technically-oriented blog or resource center on hbnobulk.com that speaks to formulators, product managers, and business owners.

Risk Assessment: Loss of Top Branded Keywords¶Scenario: Rankings for "hbno" and "hbno essential oils" drop from position 1.

Direct Traffic Impact: The immediate traffic loss would be relatively small, representing only ~6% of their current total organic traffic (~371 monthly visits).
Business Impact (Severe): The business impact would be disproportionately high.
Loss of Highest-Intent Traffic: Visitors searching for your brand name are the most qualified leads. They are past the point of discovery and are looking to purchase, log in, or contact you. Losing them means losing revenue.
Brand Erosion and Trust Damage: If a competitor, a negative review, or a distributor's page outranks your own homepage for your brand name, it creates immense confusion and damages brand credibility.
Increased CPC: The marketing team would be forced to spend more on branded PPC campaigns to reclaim that top spot, directly increasing customer acquisition costs.

Conclusion: While the traffic volume is low, protecting branded SERPs is a non-negotiable, high-priority defensive task for any business. The risk is not in the volume of traffic lost, but in the quality of that traffic and the integrity of the brand.
