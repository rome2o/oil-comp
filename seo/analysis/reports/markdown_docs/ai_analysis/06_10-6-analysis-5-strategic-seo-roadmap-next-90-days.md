Subject: 90-Day SEO Action Plan for HBNO.com / HBNOBulk.com
Allen,
Excellent work on growing impressions and improving average positions. The data shows significant top-of-funnel growth since you took over. The recent theme change has actually resulted in positive top-line metric movement (clicks, impressions, CTR, position), which is a great sign of a technically solid foundation.
Our challenge now is to capitalize on this momentum. The data reveals a significant opportunity to improve our Click-Through Rate (CTR), which is currently lagging despite high impression volumes. This tells us we are visible, but not compelling enough to click.
This 90-day plan is designed to address that gap immediately, then systematically expand our reach into valuable B2B keywords, and finally, build the authority to dominate our niche.

MONTH 1 (Days 1-30): Stabilization & Quick Wins¶Goal: Solidify the new theme's technical foundation, diagnose any hidden issues, and achieve rapid traffic gains by improving the CTR of existing rankings.

Description
Measurable KPIs

P0
Comprehensive Post-Migration Technical Audit
Use Screaming Frog to perform a full crawl. Identify and fix any 404s, redirect chains, canonical issues, or indexation problems introduced by the new theme. Pay close attention to mobile usability, site speed (Core Web Vitals), and schema markup integrity.
- Reduce internal 404 errors to zero.- Core Web Vitals (LCP, INP, CLS) in the "Good" threshold for 90%+ of URLs in GSC.

P0
"Striking Distance" CTR Optimization Campaign
Identify non-branded keywords ranking in positions 4-20 with high impressions but below-average CTR (<1%). Rewrite their title tags and meta descriptions to be more compelling, include CTAs, and better match user intent. Start with your top 50 opportunities.
- Improve average CTR by 20% for the targeted set of 50 keywords.- Increase clicks from this keyword set by 15%.

P1
Analyze & Fix Keyword Cannibalization
Use a tool like Ahrefs or Semrush to identify pages competing for the same keywords. Consolidate content where necessary, or de-optimize one page in favor of the stronger one to send clearer signals to Google.
- Resolve 80% of identified high-priority cannibalization issues.- See a measurable rank increase for the primary target URL.

P1
Optimize Branded SERP Experience
Your top queries are branded. Ensure the Search Engine Results Page (SERP) for "hbno" and its variations is flawless. Check your Google Business Profile, encourage reviews, ensure sitelinks are optimal, and see if an Organization schema is implemented correctly.
- Maintain a >60% CTR for the top 5 branded queries.- GSC shows rich results (sitelinks, reviews) for 95% of branded searches.

P2
Establish SEO Performance Dashboard
Create a Looker Studio (or similar) dashboard that pulls data from GSC, GA4, and your rank tracking tool. This will be our single source of truth for tracking progress against our goals throughout this plan.
- A live, functional dashboard is created and shared with stakeholders, tracking KPIs for traffic, rankings, and conversions.

MONTH 2 (Days 31-60): Growth Initiatives¶Goal: Expand our keyword footprint into the B2B/bulk sector and build foundational content that addresses the needs of our industrial clients.

Priority
Task
Description
Measurable KPIs

P0
B2B Keyword Gap & Opportunity Analysis
Shift focus from general "castor oil benefits" to high-intent commercial terms. Research and map out keywords like "bulk peppermint oil supplier," "wholesale carrier oils," "castor oil industrial grade," and technical queries related to product specifications (CAS numbers, purity grades).
- Identify and map 50 new high-intent B2B commercial keywords to specific product/service pages.- Define 3 new content cluster topics for B2B.

P0
Create Two "Pillar" B2B Content Pieces
Based on your research, create two comprehensive, long-form content assets targeting a B2B audience. Examples: "A Buyer's Guide to Sourcing Bulk Essential Oils" or "Understanding Oil Purity: A Guide for Manufacturers." These will serve as linkable assets and authority builders.
- Publish two 2,000+ word articles.- Achieve top 50 rankings for the primary target B2B keywords within 30 days of publishing.

P1
Optimize Top 10 B2B Product/Category Pages
Revise the on-page content for your top bulk/industrial product and category pages. Integrate the B2B keywords from your research, add technical specs, use cases for businesses, FAQs, and clear calls-to-action (e.g., "Request a Quote," "View Spec Sheet").
- Increase organic sessions to these 10 pages by 15%.- Improve rankings for at least 2 primary B2B keywords per page.

P1
Implement a Strategic Internal Linking Plan
Systematically add internal links from existing high-authority pages (like popular blog posts) to your newly optimized B2B pages and new pillar content. Use keyword-rich anchor text. This passes authority and helps Google discover the new content faster.
- Add 50+ new, relevant internal links to priority B2B pages.- See a decrease in crawl depth for key B2B pages in Screaming Frog.

P2
Analyze Competitor Content Strategy
Identify your top 3 B2B competitors. Analyze what types of content they produce (e.g., case studies, white papers, technical data sheets). Identify their most successful pieces (by traffic and links) to inform our future content calendar.
- Produce a report detailing the content strategies of 3 competitors, highlighting 10 specific content ideas for HBNO to pursue.

MONTH 3 (Days 61-90): Scale & Optimize¶Goal: Build domain authority through targeted link building and amplify the reach of our new B2B content to drive qualified leads.

Description
Measurable KPIs

P0
Digital PR Campaign for Pillar Content
Promote the two B2B pillar pieces created in Month 2. Conduct outreach to industry publications, trade associations, and relevant B2B blogs. Pitch them as a valuable resource for their audience.
- Acquire 5 new backlinks from websites with a Domain Rating (DR) of 40+.- Generate a 25% increase in referral traffic to the pillar pages.

P1
Competitor Backlink Replication
Use Ahrefs/Semrush to analyze the backlink profiles of your top 3 competitors. Identify high-quality, replicable links (e.g., directory listings, guest posts, resource pages) and create a plan to acquire similar links for HBNO.
- Identify 25 high-value, replicable backlink opportunities.- Successfully acquire 5 of the identified competitor links.

P1
Expand & Implement Schema Markup
Go beyond basic schema. Implement Product schema with offers and sku on all product pages. Use FAQPage schema on pages with Q&A sections. Ensure Organization schema is comprehensive. This helps you stand out in the SERPs.
- Implement advanced schema on 20 key product/category pages.- Achieve a 5% increase in CTR on pages with newly implemented rich results.

P2
Unlinked Brand Mention Link Building
Use a tool to find mentions of "HBNO," "Health & Beauty Natural Oils," etc., online that don't link back to your site. Reach out to the webmasters and kindly request that they add a link. This is a very effective and easy way to build authority.
- Identify 15 unlinked brand mentions.- Convert at least 30% (5 mentions) into live backlinks.

P2
Set up Conversion Tracking for B2B Leads
Ensure GA4 is precisely tracking key B2B conversions like "Request a Quote" form submissions, spec sheet downloads, and clicks on phone numbers. We must be able to attribute revenue-driving activity directly to our SEO efforts.
- Configure and verify 3 key B2B conversion goals in GA4.- The SEO dashboard accurately reports on organic-driven lead generation.

Success Metrics: End of 90 Days¶Success will be measured by tangible growth in traffic and, more importantly, qualified business leads.

Organic Traffic: Increase total monthly organic sessions from 10,353 to 13,000+ (+25%).
B2B Keyword Growth: Increase the number of non-branded, B2B-intent keywords ranking in the Top 10 from a baseline (to be established in M2) to 50+.
Qualified Leads: Increase organic-driven "Request a Quote" form submissions by 20%.
Domain Authority: Increase Ahrefs Domain Rating (DR) from 30 to 33.

Resource Requirements¶
Team:
Allen (SEO Manager): Lead for execution, analysis, and reporting.
Developer Support: (~5-10 hours/month) for implementing technical fixes, schema, and page speed improvements.
Content Writer/SME: (~20 hours/month) for creating the pillar content and optimizing existing pages with deep industry knowledge.

Tools:
Essential: Google Search Console, Google Analytics 4.
SEO Suite: Ahrefs or Semrush (for keyword research, rank tracking, competitor analysis, backlink audits).
Technical SEO: Screaming Frog SEO Spider.
Reporting: Looker Studio (or similar BI tool).

Budget:
Modest budget for content creation if an external writer is needed.
Optional budget for a Digital PR/outreach tool (e.g., Pitchbox, BuzzStream).

Risk Mitigation¶
Risk: Technical changes from the audit negatively impact the site.
Mitigation: Implement all code changes on a staging server first. Test thoroughly before pushing to the live site. Maintain regular backups.

Risk: New B2B content fails to rank or attract an audience.
Mitigation: Base all content on thorough keyword and competitor research. Don't just publish; actively promote the content through outreach and internal linking as outlined in the plan.

Risk: A major Google Algorithm Update disrupts our progress.
Mitigation: This plan is built on SEO best practices (E-E-A-T, technical excellence, user-focused content), making it resilient. If an update hits, we will pause, analyze the impact, and adjust the strategy accordingly rather than making knee-jerk changes.
