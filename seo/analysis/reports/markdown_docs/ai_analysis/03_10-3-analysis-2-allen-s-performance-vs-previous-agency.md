SEO Performance Evaluation: Allen (In-House) vs. Previous Agency¶To: Management
From: SEO Consultant
Date: July 22, 2025
Subject: Performance Analysis of In-House SEO Manager, Allen (Feb 12 - July 18, 2025)
This report provides an objective evaluation of the company's in-house SEO efforts managed by Allen, specifically for the period prior to the recent website theme change. This isolates the impact of his strategic and tactical execution compared to the performance of the previous external agency.

1. Overall Performance Assessment¶Grade: B
Allen has made a significant and positive impact in his first five months. He successfully executed a foundational strategy focused on dramatically increasing the website's overall visibility and traffic, achieving results that far surpass the previous agency in top-line metrics.
The strategy has shifted from a narrow, high-engagement approach (agency) to a broad-net, high-volume approach (Allen). This has resulted in a massive 222% increase in average daily clicks and a staggering 627% increase in daily impressions. His work has also improved the site's average ranking position by nearly 20%.
The grade is a "B" and not an "A" due to the severe 78% decline in Click-Through Rate (CTR). While the traffic gains are impressive, the low CTR indicates a significant opportunity to improve targeting, messaging, and user engagement, which is the critical next step in maturing the SEO program.

2. Strengths¶Allen has demonstrated clear strengths in foundational and growth-focused SEO tactics.

Massive Visibility Expansion: The 627% increase in impressions is the standout metric. This indicates Allen has been highly effective at technical SEO, on-page optimization, and expanding keyword targeting. The website is now visible for a much wider array of search queries than ever before, building a strong foundation for future growth.
Effective Traffic Generation: The primary goal of SEO is to drive qualified traffic. An increase of 222% in daily clicks is an exceptional achievement in just five months. He has successfully translated expanded visibility into tangible visits.
Consistent Ranking Improvement: Lowering the average position from 34 to 28 is a difficult task. This shows that his optimizations are being rewarded by search engines and the site's overall authority is likely improving. He is successfully moving the needle across a large set of keywords.

3. Areas for Improvement¶The data points clearly to one primary area for strategic refinement.

Critically Low Click-Through Rate (CTR): The drop from 5.47% to 1.20% is the most significant concern. This suggests a potential disconnect between the search queries the site is ranking for and the value proposition presented in the search results.
Possible Cause: The broad-net strategy is likely targeting many top-of-funnel, informational keywords where user intent is not commercial.
Possible Cause: Title tags and meta descriptions may not be compelling enough to entice clicks, even when the site ranks for relevant terms.

Traffic Quality vs. Quantity: While traffic volume is high, the low CTR may be an early indicator that the new traffic is less qualified than the traffic generated by the agency's hyper-focused strategy. We need to analyze conversion data (e.g., quote requests, contact form submissions) from this new traffic to understand its business value.

4. Competitive Analysis (Industry Benchmarks)¶For a B2B oil and gas company, SEO metrics behave differently than in B2C.

Impressions & Clicks: The growth Allen achieved (+627% impressions, +222% clicks) is well above industry benchmarks. A typical "good" year-over-year growth target might be 20-30%. Allen achieved this in five months, which is exceptional.
Average Position: An average position of ~28 is not uncommon for a B2B site targeting a wide range of industry terms. The key is the improvement of 18.54%, which is a strong positive signal.
Click-Through Rate (CTR): A CTR of 1.20% is below the industry average. While B2B CTRs are generally lower than B2C, a healthy average for non-branded terms often falls in the 2-4% range. The agency's 5.47% was exceptionally high, suggesting they were likely focused on a very small set of branded or high-intent, bottom-of-funnel keywords. Allen’s current CTR shows a clear opportunity for optimization.

5. ROI Evaluation: Is the In-House Approach Working?¶Yes, the in-house approach is demonstrating a strong preliminary return on investment.
From a pure traffic acquisition standpoint, the investment in Allen is paying off significantly. He is generating over 3 times the daily clicks the agency was delivering. When you compare his salary to the likely much higher cost of an agency retainer that was producing fewer results, the Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) on a visitor level has decreased dramatically.
The caveat is that this evaluation is based on traffic, not leads or sales. The next step is to connect this traffic to business outcomes. However, by successfully building the top of the funnel, Allen has created a much larger pool of potential customers to engage.

6. Strategic Recommendations for Next Quarter¶Allen has successfully built the foundation. Now, he must focus on optimization and quality.

Primary Focus: Aggressive CTR Optimization:

Action: Conduct a full audit of title tags and meta descriptions for the top 50-100 pages driving the most impressions.
Goal: Rewrite them to be more compelling, include a clear value proposition, and use calls-to-action (e.g., "Request a Quote," "Download Spec Sheet"). A/B test different versions to find what resonates.
Target: Increase the average CTR from 1.20% to over 2.5% within the next 6 months.

Keyword Intent Segmentation:

Action: Analyze the keywords driving the new impressions and clicks. Categorize them into Informational ("what is crude oil refining"), Commercial ("best lubricant suppliers"), and Transactional ("buy hydraulic oil in bulk").
Goal: Prioritize CTR and on-page optimization efforts for the commercial and transactional terms, as they are closest to driving revenue. Ensure the landing pages for these terms directly meet the user's needs.

Integrate with Business Goals (Lead/Conversion Tracking):

Action: Work with the web and sales teams to ensure conversion tracking (form fills, phone calls, downloads) is properly implemented and attributed to organic search.
Goal: Begin reporting not just on clicks and impressions, but on "Organic-Sourced Leads." This will provide a definitive measure of ROI and help prove the business case for his strategies.

By focusing on these three areas, Allen can build upon his impressive initial success, improve the quality of the traffic he is generating, and demonstrate a clear and powerful impact on the company's bottom line.
