## Analysis Phases

### Phase 1: Data Preparation & Initial Review
- [x] Convert all relevant data (CSVs, XLSX) into a standardized, machine-readable format (e.g., pandas DataFrames in Python). (Note: Ahrefs CSVs failed to load due to parsing errors, requiring manual inspection or specialized tools.)
- [ ] Review PDF reports manually to extract key insights and data points not available in structured formats.
- [ ] Output: Cleaned and structured datasets for each source.

### Phase 2: Baseline & Historical Performance Analysis
- [ ] Establish a baseline for SEO performance *before* Allen's involvement (prior to February 12th, 2025) using available historical data.
- [ ] Establish a baseline for SEO performance *before* the theme change (prior to July 19th, 2025).
- [ ] Output: Defined baseline metrics for key SEO indicators (traffic, rankings, backlinks, core web vitals).

### Phase 3: Theme Change Impact Analysis
- [ ] Analyze Google Analytics data (traffic acquisition, pages & screens) to identify changes in user behavior and traffic patterns immediately following July 19th, 2025.
- [ ] Examine Google Search Console performance data (clicks, impressions, CTR, position) for any significant shifts post-theme change.
- [ ] Review Core Web Vitals data from GSC to assess any impact on site speed and user experience.
- [ ] Output: Report on the positive, negative, or neutral impact of the theme change on SEO.

### Phase 4: Allen's SEO Efforts Analysis
- [ ] Compare SEO performance metrics (from Ahrefs, GA, GSC) from February 12th, 2025, onwards against the established baseline (pre-Allen).
- [ ] Analyze organic keyword performance and backlink profile changes (from Ahrefs) to evaluate the effectiveness of strategies implemented by Allen.
- [ ] Correlate specific SEO activities (if documented) with observed performance changes.
- [ ] Output: Assessment of the effectiveness of Allen's SEO efforts, highlighting areas of success and areas needing improvement.

### Phase 5: Reporting & Recommendations
- [ ] Consolidate findings from all phases into a comprehensive SEO analysis report.
- [ ] Provide actionable recommendations for future SEO strategy, addressing identified issues and capitalizing on opportunities.
