### Content Strategy & Keyword Research

Before writing, understand the goal of your post.
-   **Identify the Target Audience:** Who are you writing for?
-   **Determine the Primary Keyword:** What search term do you want this post to rank for? (e.g., "how to use lavender oil").
-   **Identify Secondary Keywords:** What other related terms can you include? (e.g., "lavender oil benefits," "aromatherapy with lavender").

### Drafting Your Content

-   **Compelling Title:** Create a title that is engaging and includes your primary keyword.
-   **Structured Outline:** Plan your post with a clear hierarchy. Use headings and subheadings to break up the text and make it easy to read.
-   **Engaging Introduction:** Hook the reader in the first paragraph and clearly state what the post is about.
-   **Valuable Body Content:** Provide informative, well-researched, and original content. Naturally integrate your primary and secondary keywords.
-   **Clear Conclusion:** Summarize the key takeaways and include a call-to-action (e.g., "Shop our essential oils now," "Leave a comment with your favorite use case").

### Step-by-Step: Creating the Blog Post in Shopify

1.  In your Shopify admin, navigate to **Online Store > Blog posts**.
2.  Click the **Create blog post** button.
3.  **Enter the Title:** Paste your final title into the "Title" field.
4.  **Add the Content:** Paste your drafted content into the "Content" rich text editor.
5.  **Format Your Content:**
    -   Use the editor's formatting tools to apply **bold**, *italics*, and create lists.
    -   Select your subheadings and format them as **Heading 2** or **Heading 3**. Never use Heading 1, as the post title is automatically the H1.
    -   Add links to other relevant blog posts or products on our store to encourage internal navigation.

### On-Page SEO Best Practices

This is a critical step for search engine visibility.

1.  Scroll down to the **Search engine listing preview** section and click **Edit website SEO**.
2.  **Page title:** This is what appears in the browser tab and on Google. It should be under 60 characters. You can make it slightly different from your main blog post title for optimization.
3.  **Meta description:** This is the short summary that appears under your title on Google. Write a compelling description (under 160 characters) that includes your primary keyword and encourages clicks.
4.  **URL and handle:** The handle is the end part of the URL. Shopify automatically creates it from your title. Keep it short, descriptive, and include your primary keyword (e.g., `how-to-use-lavender-oil`).

### Image Optimization

1.  **Add a Featured Image:** In the **Featured image** section on the right, click **Add image**. This is the main image that will appear on your blog's index page.
2.  **Optimize the Featured Image:** Before uploading, ensure the image is:
    -   **Sized appropriately:** A width of 1200px is a good standard.
    -   **Compressed:** Use a tool like TinyPNG to reduce the file size for faster loading.
    -   **Named descriptively:** `how-to-use-lavender-oil.jpg` is better than `IMG_1234.jpg`.
3.  **Add Alt Text:** After uploading the featured image, click the "Edit" link on the image and add descriptive alt text. This is essential for accessibility and SEO.

### Publishing and Scheduling

In the **Organization** section on the right:

1.  **Author:** Select the correct author from the dropdown.
2.  **Blog:** You must select the **"Natural Essential Oils"** blog from the dropdown. This is the primary blog for all our posts.
3.  **Tags:** Add your relevant tags (e.g., `Essential Oils`, `DIY`, `Wellness`). This helps with filtering and organization.
4.  **Visibility:**
    -   To publish immediately, select **Visible**.
    -   To save it as a draft, select **Hidden**.
    -   To schedule for a future date, select **Visible** and set a **Publish date** in the future.
5.  Click **Save**.

### Post-Publish Checklist

- [ ] **Check Links:** Click on all internal and external links to make sure they work.

### Comment Moderation

Managing comments is crucial for maintaining a professional and trustworthy blog. It prevents spam and encourages genuine engagement.

#### Moderation Workflow

1.  **Review Pending Comments Regularly:** Check the comments section at least once a week.
2.  **Identify Spam:** A comment is likely spam if it:
    -   Is generic and not relevant to the blog post (e.g., "Great post!", "Thanks for sharing.").
    -   Contains suspicious links.
    -   Is written in a foreign language and seems out of context.
    -   Promotes an unrelated product or service.
3.  **Take Action:**
    -   For spam comments, click the comment and select **Mark as spam**. This helps Shopify's filter learn.
    -   For legitimate comments from readers, click **Publish**.
    -   It is good practice to reply to genuine comments to foster a sense of community.

#### Important Note on Published Spam

Currently, there are spam comments that have been mistakenly approved. You can clean this up by going to the [Published Comments](https://admin.shopify.com/store/hbno-inc/content/comments?status=PUBLISHED) section, selecting the spam comments, and marking them as spam.

### Common Issues & Solutions

-   **"Post is not appearing on the blog page"**: This is most often because the post was not assigned to the correct blog.
    -   **Solution:** In the post editor, go to the **Organization** section and ensure that **"Natural Essential Oils"** is selected in the **Blog** dropdown. If it is still not visible, check **Online Store > Navigation** to ensure the blog is linked in a menu.
-   **"Images are blurry or slow to load"**: The images were not optimized before uploading.
    -   **Solution:** Replace the image with one that has been resized and compressed for the web.
-   **"Meta description is cut off in search results"**: The description is longer than the recommended 160 characters.
    -   **Solution:** Edit the meta description to be more concise while still being compelling.
