# Product Metadata Completion Checklist

This checklist is designed to guide the team in filling out the crucial metadata for our Shopify products based on the `products_export.csv` file. Completing these fields is essential for SEO, site usability, and customer experience.

### High Priority - Must Be Completed

- [ ] **Image Alt Text:**
    - **Action:** Fill this out for every single product and variant image.
    - **Guideline:** Write a descriptive sentence explaining what the image shows. Good Example: "A clear glass bottle of HBNO's You Glow Girl Facial Serum with a white dropper cap." Bad Example: "product image".

- [ ] **Variant SKU:**
    - **Action:** Verify that every single variant has a unique SKU.
    - **Guideline:** No two rows in the final CSV should have the same SKU. This is critical for inventory.

- [ ] **Tags:**
    - **Action:** Review and standardize tags for all products.
    - **Guideline:** Use tags to create logical groups for collections. For example, all essential oils must have the `essential-oil` tag. All organic products must have the `organic` tag.

### Medium Priority - Highly Recommended

- [ ] **SEO Title & Description Review:**
    - **Action:** Review the existing SEO titles and descriptions.
    - **Guideline:**
        - **SEO Title:** Keep it under 60 characters. Make it compelling and keyword-rich.
        - **SEO Description:** Keep it under 160 characters. It should be an engaging summary.

- [ ] **Custom Metafields Consistency:**
    - **Action:** Audit the custom metafields for completeness across all relevant products.
    - **Guideline:** Ensure that for every essential oil, fields like `BOTANICAL NAME`, `COUNTRY OF ORIGIN`, `EXTRACTION METHOD`, and `Oil Part of Plant` are populated.

- [ ] **Shopify Product Category:**
    - **Action:** Review the assigned `Product Category` for accuracy.
    - **Guideline:** Choose the most specific category possible from Shopify's official taxonomy. This helps with tax calculation and sales channel integrations.

### Low Priority - Optional but Recommended

- [ ] **Google Shopping Fields:**
    - **Action:** If planning to use Google Shopping, populate these fields.
    - **Guideline:** Focus on `Google Shopping / Google Product Category` and `Google Shopping / MPN` if applicable.

- [ ] **Variant Barcode:**
    - **Action:** If you use a barcode system for inventory, fill in this column.
    - **Guideline:** Otherwise, this can be left blank.
