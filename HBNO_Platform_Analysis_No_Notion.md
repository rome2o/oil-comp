### **Part 1: Market Scan & Comparative Analysis**

The following platforms were evaluated against HBNO's core requirements and Devkind's strategic mandates. A new contender, Teamwork.com, has been added for its strong, integrated suite of tools.

| Platform | Platform Type | Ideal for HBNO Team Size | Indicative Pricing | Recurring Commission % | Commission Strategy | API Rich-Text Capable? | Google Workspace Integration Score |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **ClickUp** | All-in-One PM/KM | 20-1,000 users | $12/user/month (Business) | **20% recurring lifetime** | Direct affiliate program. Excellent long-term value proposition for Devkind. | **Yes** ([Link](https://clickup.com/api/clickup-api/operations/CreateDoc/)) | Good |
| **Teamwork.com** | Integrated Suite (PM+KM) | 10-500 users | $19.99/user/month (Grow) | 30% recurring for 1 year | Direct partner program. Strong initial return, competitive with top-tier programs. | **Yes** ([Link](https://apidocs.teamwork.com/docs/teamwork/v3/notebooks/post-projects-api-v3-notebooks-json)) | Excellent |
| **Monday.com** | PM-First | 50-2,000 users | $16/user/month (Standard) | 20-25% recurring for 1 year | Partner program with tiers. Requires active co-selling for higher commission. | **Yes** ([Link](https://developer.monday.com/api-reference/docs/updates#create-an-update-)) | Good |
| **Asana** | PM-First | 50-5,000+ users | $24.99/user/month (Business) | 20-30% via "Solutions Partner" | High barrier to entry (certification required). Less focus on KM. | Yes, but less ideal for KM | Fair |
| **Jira & Confluence** | Separate PM/KM | 100-10,000+ users | ~$21/user/month (Standard) | Tiered % via "Atlassian Partner" | Most complex program. Can be overkill for a team of HBNO's current size. | **Yes** ([Link](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/rest/v2/api-group-page/#api-pages-post)) | Good |

### **Part 2: In-Depth Platform Profiles**

#### **1. ClickUp**

*   **Executive Summary:** With Notion excluded, ClickUp emerges as the clear front-runner. It is a true "all-in-one" platform that provides robust, dedicated features for both project management and knowledge management. Its key differentiator for Devkind is the **lifetime recurring commission**, which creates a powerful long-term partnership asset.
*   **Project & Knowledge Management Capabilities:**

### **Part 3: Strategic Recommendation & Actionable Insights**

#### **Top Recommendation: ClickUp**

ClickUp is the best choice for HBNO in a Notion-free landscape. It provides a truly unified platform that minimizes friction between project execution and knowledge documentation, and its partnership model is uniquely aligned with Devkind's long-term goals.

*   **Client-Side Justification:** It is a single source of truth. HBNO teams won't have to switch between different apps for PM and KM. Its feature depth ensures it can handle the specific operational needs of Sales, Sourcing, and Marketing within one platform.
*   **Devkind-Side Justification:** The **20% lifetime recurring commission** is the most compelling financial incentive for a long-term partnership. It creates a predictable, growing revenue stream that justifies a deep investment in implementation, training, and ongoing support for HBNO.

#### **Strong Alternative: Teamwork.com**

Teamwork.com is an excellent runner-up and would be a better choice under specific circumstances:

*   **If HBNO prefers a "suite of apps" model over an "all-in-one" model.** If their teams value the distinct, dedicated interfaces of separate PM and KM tools (that are still perfectly integrated), Teamwork.com is the ideal solution. Its excellent Google Drive integration is also a major plus.

#### **Implementation Roadmap**

Devkind should propose the following plan, centered around ClickUp:

1.  **Step 1: Formalize Partnership (Internal):** Immediately sign up for the ClickUp Affiliate Program to secure our lifetime commission status.
2.  **Step 2: Propose a Paid Pilot (Client-Facing):** Propose a 30-day paid pilot with HBNO's Marketing and Operations teams to demonstrate the platform's dual strengths in content management (Docs) and process management (Tasks/Gantt).
3.  **Step 3: Build a Proof-of-Concept (Value Showcase):** Use n8n/Zapier to build a workflow that migrates 5-10 key articles into a ClickUp Doc. Simultaneously, map one of the Operations team's critical Google Sheets checklists into a ClickUp task template with dependencies. This showcases both KM and PM value immediately.
4.  **Step 4: Full Rollout & Training:** Based on the pilot's success, present a full implementation and data migration plan, including role-specific training for all HBNO teams.

#### **Risks & Mitigation**

*   **Risk:** Feature overload and complexity can overwhelm users.
    *   **Mitigation:** Devkind's implementation will focus on configuring a simplified "essentials" workspace for HBNO, hiding unnecessary features initially. We will use role-based training to introduce advanced functionality only as needed.
*   **Risk:** Migrating complex, formula-heavy Google Sheets may require workflow redesign.
    *   **Mitigation:** Set clear expectations upfront. Devkind will perform an audit of the most critical spreadsheets and propose new, more efficient workflows using ClickUp's native features (like automations and custom fields) rather than attempting a direct 1:1 migration of complex formulas.
