## Critical Notes & Recommendations

### ⚠️ Data Quality Issues

The baseline metrics show unusual values that require validation:

1. **Monthly Revenue ($862):** Extremely low - verify this is actual revenue
2. **Conversion Rate (402%):** Mathematically impossible - data issue
3. **AOV ($92,588):** Unrealistically high - check calculation
4. **ROI Projections:** Currently negative due to low baseline

### Recommended Actions Before Proposal

1. **Validate Baseline Data:**
   - Confirm actual monthly revenue with client
   - Review Shopify admin for accurate figures
   - Check if data is from test environment

2. **Adjust Pricing if Needed:**
   - If revenue is truly $862/month, consider:
     - Starter tier may be more appropriate
     - Performance-based pricing model
     - Percentage of revenue increase model

3. **Recalculate Projections:**
   - With validated baseline data
   - Update ROI expectations
   - Adjust opportunity sizing

4. **Set Realistic Expectations:**
   - Conservative first-year goals
   - Focus on percentage improvements
   - Emphasize long-term partnership value
