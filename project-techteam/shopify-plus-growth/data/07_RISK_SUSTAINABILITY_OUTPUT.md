## 🛡️ Workload Protection Guardrails

### Hour Allocation System

| Tier    | Monthly Hours | Weekly Hours | Daily Cap | Carryover Policy | Utilization Alerts | Over-Hours Process |
|---------|---------------|--------------|-----------|------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Starter | 20            | 5            | 2         | Max 5 hrs        | 80% = yellow       | Change Order       |
| Growth  | 40            | 10           | 3         | Max 10 hrs       | 90% = orange       | Change Order       |
| Plus    | 60            | 15           | 4         | Max 15 hrs       | 100%+ = red        | Change Order       |

### Core Principles

**1. NO UNPAID OVERAGES**
- Team members always paid fairly for their time
- Any work beyond allocation = Change Order + payment
- Protects team morale and retention

**2. CLEAR BOUNDARIES**
- Scope document signed by both parties
- Monthly tracking prevents surprise issues
- Change management process is fair and transparent

**3. TEAM FIRST**
- Employee satisfaction leads to better client results
- Burned-out team = poor quality & higher turnover costs
- Investment in team health pays dividends

**4. DATA-DRIVEN MANAGEMENT**
- Weekly time tracking (not estimates)
- Monthly metrics dashboards
- Early warning system for issues

**5. CLIENT SUCCESS & PREDICTABILITY**
- Client knows exactly what they're getting
- Clear hour budget prevents surprises
- Transparent pricing builds trust
