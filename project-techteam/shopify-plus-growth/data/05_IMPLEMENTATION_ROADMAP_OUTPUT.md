# Phase 5: Implementation Roadmap - Output Summary

**Generated:** November 14, 2025  
**Status:** REVISED - Focused on Add-to-Cart Optimization

## Overview

This defines a 90-day implementation plan for the Growth Tier service ($9,500/mo, 40-50 hours/month HARD CAP), focused exclusively on solving HBNO's add-to-cart crisis (2.03% → target 3.5-4.0%).

---

## Risk Mitigation & Contingencies

### If Add-to-Cart Improvement < 30% by Day 30

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Deep dive into mobile vs desktop performance (is it a mobile-specific issue?)
- Page speed audit (are slow-loading pages killing add-to-cart?)
- Trust signal effectiveness review (are customers hesitant?)
- Product content audit (are descriptions/images compelling enough?)
- Heatmap analysis (are users scrolling to add-to-cart button?)

**Tactical Pivots:**
- If mobile is the issue: Triple down on mobile optimization
- If speed is the issue: Prioritize performance optimization over new features
- If trust is the issue: Accelerate testimonials, reviews, guarantees
- If content is weak: Pause new pages, improve existing ones first

**Communication:**
- Weekly client sync (instead of bi-weekly) to diagnose issues quickly
- Transparent data sharing: show what's working and what's not
- Adjust Month 2 plan based on findings

---

### If Add-to-Cart Improvement > 40% by Day 30

**Accelerated Plan:**
- Scale winning variations faster to more products
- Expand testing to mid-tier products (not just top sellers)
- Consider upgrading to Plus Tier for full-catalog optimization
- Increase testing velocity (more tests in parallel)

**Strategic Consideration:**
- Document what's working (create playbook for future products)
- Share learnings across product categories
- Prepare client for potential upgrade conversation

---

### If Client Bottlenecks Slow Progress

**Common Bottlenecks:**
- Slow decision-making on A/B test approvals
- Delayed asset delivery (images, copy, product info)
- Internal approval processes stalling implementations
- Limited Shopify access or permissions

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Front-load approvals: Get Month 2-3 buy-in during Month 1
- Asset pipeline: Request all needed assets upfront
- Pre-approved testing framework: "Green light" standard tests without case-by-case approval
- Escalation protocol: Clear path to decision-makers

---

## Hour Management & Workload Protection

### 80% Utilization Alert (32-40 hours used in Growth Tier)

**Actions:**
- Alert client to remaining capacity (8-18 hours)
- Prioritize highest-ROI activities only
- Defer "nice-to-have" items to next month
- Discuss change order if critical new work emerges

**Communication Script:**
"We're at 80% capacity this month. We have X hours remaining, which we recommend using for Y (highest-impact initiative). If Z becomes urgent, we can handle it as a change order or schedule for next month."

---

### Hard Cap Enforcement (50 hours in Growth Tier)

**What Happens at 48 Hours:**
- Stop all new work immediately
- Use remaining 2 hours for essential reporting only
- Client communication: "We've reached our hour cap for this month to protect team sustainability. New requests will be scheduled for next month."

**Why This Matters:**
- Prevents team burnout
- Forces prioritization of highest-impact work
- Protects long-term service quality
- Sets healthy client expectations
