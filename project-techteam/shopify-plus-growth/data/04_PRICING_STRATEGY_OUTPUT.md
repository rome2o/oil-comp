## Important Notes

⚠️ **Baseline Data Review Needed:**

The current baseline revenue ($862/month) appears unusually low and may indicate:
- Data quality issues in Phase 1
- Incomplete dataset
- Test environment data

**Impact on Pricing:**
- ROI calculations show negative returns
- Suggests pricing may be too high for current revenue
- OR baseline data needs validation

**Recommendations:**
1. Validate actual monthly revenue with client
2. Review data extraction methodology
3. Adjust pricing if baseline is accurate
4. Consider Starter tier for smaller operations
5. Alternative: charge based on % of revenue increase
