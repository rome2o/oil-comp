## Pricing Quick Reference

### Tier Pricing (Value-Based)

| Tier | Monthly Price | Monthly Hours | Annual Cost | Expected Add-to-Cart | Revenue Gain | ROI |
|------|---------------|---------------|-------------|---------------------|--------------|-----|
| **Starter** | $6,500 | 20-25 | $78,000 | 3.0% | +$42K/mo | 6.5x |
| **Growth** ⭐ | $9,500 | 40-50 | $114,000 | 4.0% | +$97K/mo | 10x |
| **Plus** | $15,000 | 60-80 | $180,000 | 5.0% | +$151K/mo | 10x |

## Baseline Context

### Current Performance (Last 30 Days)
- **Monthly Revenue:** $120,000
- **Sessions:** 36,490
- **Orders:** 272
- **Site Conversion:** 0.72%
- **Add-to-Cart Rate:** 2.03% ⚠️ ROOT CAUSE
- **Checkout Conversion:** 53.3% ✅ Good
- **AOV:** $459
- **Bounce Rate:** 85%

### The Problem
Only **2.03% of visitors add items to cart**. Checkout is fine (53.3%), so the issue is product page engagement, not the checkout flow.

### The Opportunity
- Increase add-to-cart from 2.03% → 4-5%
- This translates to 0.72% → 1.4-1.8% site conversion
- Revenue opportunity: $262K/month total

---

## Pricing Philosophy

### Value-Based, Not Cost-Plus

**Why This Approach:**
- Priced on outcome potential (add-to-cart improvement = revenue)
- Client pays for results, not just hours
- ROI of 6-10x justifies investment
- Conservative projections (under-promise, over-deliver)

**Key Differentiator:**
Traditional agencies charge for "SEO work" or "marketing hours." We charge for solving the specific problem: getting visitors to add products to cart.

---

## Workload Protection (Built-In)

### Hard Hour Caps

| Tier | Monthly Hours | Team | Overage Policy |
|------|---------------|------|----------------|
| Starter | 20-25 MAX | 1 person | Stop at 25hrs, discuss scope |
| Growth | 40-50 MAX | 2 people | Stop at 50hrs, escalate |
| Plus | 60-80 MAX | 2-3 people | Stop at 80hrs, renegotiate |

**Change Request Process:**
- Any work beyond scope = written approval + additional fee
- Mid-month scope changes = next month delivery
- Emergency requests = 1.5x hourly rate

---

## Payment & Contract Terms

### Standard Terms

**Billing:**
- Monthly recurring invoice
- Payment due within 15 days
- Auto-pay available (ACH/credit card)

**Contract:**
- 3-month minimum commitment
- Month-to-month after initial period
- 30-day cancellation notice

**Scope Management:**
- Deliverables defined in contract
- Hour caps enforced (20/40-50/60-80)
- Change orders for out-of-scope work
- Quarterly scope reviews

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Baseline Data Review Needed:**

The current baseline revenue ($862/month) appears unusually low and may indicate:
- Data quality issues in Phase 1
- Incomplete dataset
- Test environment data

**Impact on Pricing:**
- ROI calculations show negative returns
- Suggests pricing may be too high for current revenue
- OR baseline data needs validation

**Recommendations:**
1. Validate actual monthly revenue with client
2. Review data extraction methodology
3. Adjust pricing if baseline is accurate
4. Consider Starter tier for smaller operations
5. Alternative: charge based on % of revenue increase
