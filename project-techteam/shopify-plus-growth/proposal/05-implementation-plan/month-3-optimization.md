## ⚠️ Risk Management

### Potential Challenges

**Challenge 1: 5.0% target more difficult than expected**
- Mitigation: Focus on highest-leverage tactics (top products, mobile, personalization)
- Backup: Accept 4.8% as "close enough" (+136% vs +146% target)

**Challenge 2: Authority content may not drive immediate results**
- Expectation: B2B authority is 6-12 month investment, not 90-day
- Justification: Sets foundation for 2026 growth

**Challenge 3: Optimizing 10-15 additional products is time-intensive**
- Mitigation: Use templates and automation
- Backup: Optimize top-revenue products first, defer long-tail

### Hour Cap Protection

**Month 3 Hour Budget: 65 hours (Growth Tier)**

- Week 9-10: 55 hours (Refinement)
- Week 11-12: 45 hours (Authority + Report)
- **Total: 100 hours estimated**
