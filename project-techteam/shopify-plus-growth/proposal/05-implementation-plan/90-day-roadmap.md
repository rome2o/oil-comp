# Implementation Roadmap: 90 Days to 3.5% A2C, 12 Months to 5.0%

**Program:** Product Page Optimization + Traffic Quality  
**Client:** HBNO Essential Natural Oils  
**Initial Phase:** 90 Days (Foundation)  
**Full Optimization:** 12 Months  
**Recommended Tier:** Growth ($11,500/month)

---

## 🎯 Program Overview

This roadmap executes a **dual-track optimization strategy** that addresses both root causes of HBNO's low add-to-cart rate:

**Track 1: Traffic Quality** - Gradual shift from informational (90%) to commercial/transactional (40%+) traffic over 6-12 months  
**Track 2: Product Pages** - Rapid optimization for engagement and conversion of all visitors

**Why Traffic Quality Takes Longer:**

- 1,621 toxic backlinks require 3-6 months for Google to fully process after disavowal
- Existing informational content rankings take 4-6 months to shift
- New transactional content needs 2-4 months to establish authority
- Traffic mix at 90 days: ~75/25 (informational/transactional), improving to 40/60 by 12 months

**Target Outcomes:**

- **90 Days:** 2.03% → 3.5% A2C | +$77K/month revenue
- **6 Months:** 2.03% → 4.5% A2C | +$135K/month revenue
- **12 Months:** 2.03% → 5.0%+ A2C | +$165K+/month revenue
