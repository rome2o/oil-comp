## 🎯 The Problem

**Only 2 out of 100 visitors add products to cart.**

Your checkout is excellent (53.3%). The issue is product page engagement—visitors don't add items because pages lack trust signals, mobile optimization, and clear value communication.

## 💡 The Solution: Product Page Optimization Program

Systematic optimization of product pages to improve add-to-cart conversion through:

- Product page redesigns (prioritized by revenue)
- Trust signal implementation (reviews, guarantees, certifications)
- A/B testing program for validation
- Mobile-first optimization
- Site performance improvements
- Commercial keyword SEO
