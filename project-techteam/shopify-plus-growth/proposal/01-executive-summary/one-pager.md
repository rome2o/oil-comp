**Symptom:** Only 2.03% of visitors add to cart (industry standard: 8-10%)| Metric | Current | Industry Standard | Status |

|--------|---------|-------------------|--------|

**Root Cause #1 (Primary - 70% of problem):** **Wrong Traffic = Wrong Audience**| **Add-to-Cart Rate** | **2.03%** | 8-10% | ⚠️ 75% below standard |

| Checkout Conversion | 53.3% | 50-60% | ✅ Excellent |

- <1% transactional traffic (ready to buy)| Monthly Revenue | $120,000 | - | Baseline |

- Missing ALL high-value B2B keywords ("bulk supplier", "wholesale", "private label")| Bounce Rate | 85% | 60-70% | ⚠️ High |

| AOV | $459 | - | Strong |

**Root Cause #2 (Secondary - 30% of problem):** **Product Page Optimization Needs**

---

- 85% mobile bounce rate (critical UX issue)

- Missing trust signals (COAs, certifications, reviews)## 🎯 The Problem

- Weak add-to-cart buttons and mobile experience

**Only 2 out of 100 visitors add products to cart.**

**Key Insight:** Even perfect product pages can't convert visitors researching "how to use tea tree oil on dogs." You need the RIGHT visitors on RIGHT pages.

Your checkout is excellent (53.3%). The issue is product page engagement—visitors don't add items because pages lack trust signals, mobile optimization, and clear value communication.
