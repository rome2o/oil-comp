**Prepared for:** HBNO Essential Natural Oils  
**Prepared by:** Devkind  
**Date:** November 14, 2025  
**Recommended Investment:** $11,500/month (Growth Tier)

---

## The Situation

HBNO is a thriving essential oils e-commerce business generating **$120,000/month** ($1.44M annually) on Shopify Plus. Your checkout process is performing excellently with a **53.3% conversion rate**—meaning once customers start checkout, more than half complete their purchase.

However, deep analysis of your conversion funnel reveals a critical bottleneck earlier in the journey:

### The Core Problem: Add-to-Cart Crisis

**Only 2.03% of visitors add products to their cart.**

Industry standard for e-commerce is 8-10%. This means:

- Out of every 100 visitors, only 2 engage enough to add items
- 98 visitors leave without ever considering a purchase
- Your excellent checkout never gets the chance to convert them

**Current Performance (Last 30 Days):**

- 36,490 sessions
- Only 739 added items to cart (2.03%)
- 272 completed orders (0.72% site conversion)
- 53.3% checkout conversion ✅ (this is excellent)

### Root Cause Analysis: The Real Problem is Traffic Quality

Our comprehensive SEO analysis reveals that **low add-to-cart rates aren't just a product page problem—it's primarily a traffic quality problem.** You're attracting the wrong audience.

**The Traffic Quality Crisis:**

**Current Traffic Profile (SEO Analysis):**
- **90%+ Informational Intent** - visitors seeking "how-to" content, not buyers
- **<1% Transactional Intent** - almost no visitors ready to purchase
- **CTR Declined 78%** - from 5.47% to 1.20% despite traffic growth
- **5.92% Branded Traffic** - weak brand awareness in B2B industrial space

**Example Keywords Driving Traffic:**
- "how to dilute tea tree oil for dogs" (1,400/month)
- "benefits of helichrysum oil" (3,300/month)
- "neem oil side effects" (informational queries)

**Missing B2B Commercial Keywords:**
- "bulk essential oil suppliers"
- "wholesale castor oil"
- "essential oils for cosmetic formulation"
- "private label essential oil supplier"

**What This Means:** You've successfully built B2C blog traffic (222% increase in clicks), but you're attracting wellness seekers researching home remedies—not businesses looking to purchase in bulk. Even perfect product pages won't convert visitors who came to learn "how to use tea tree oil on dogs."

**The Dual Problem:**
1. **Wrong Audience** - 90%+ informational traffic with zero purchase intent
2. **Product Page Issues** - Lack of trust signals, poor mobile UX, weak CTAs for the small % of qualified traffic that does arrive

---

## The Opportunity

Improving both traffic quality AND add-to-cart rate creates a multiplier effect:

**Scenario 1: Product Pages Only (Original Target)**

- Add-to-Cart: 2.03% → 3.5% at 90 days
- Same traffic quality (90% informational)
- Revenue increase: +$77K/month at 90 days

**Scenario 2: Traffic Quality + Product Pages (v2 Approach - Phased Timeline)**

- **90 Days:** 2.03% → 3.5% A2C (+$77K/month) - Page optimization drives initial gains
- **6 Months:** 3.5% → 4.5% A2C (+$135K/month) - Traffic quality begins shifting
- **12 Months:** 4.5% → 5.0%+ A2C (+$165K+/month) - Full traffic transformation complete

**Why Traffic Quality Takes Longer:**

- 1,621 toxic backlinks require 3-6 months for Google to process after disavowal
- Existing informational content rankings take 4-6 months to shift
- New transactional content needs 2-4 months to establish authority
- Traffic mix at 90 days: ~75/25 (informational/transactional), improving to 40/60 by 12 months

This is achievable because:

1. Your checkout already works well—no need to fix what isn't broken
2. Product page optimization delivers immediate improvements (90 days to 3.5%)
3. **Commercial keyword targeting is highly predictable** - shifting from "how-to" to "buy bulk" queries takes 6-12 months
4. We've identified specific, actionable improvements through data analysis
5. Your top 3 products (Rosemary, Peppermint, Lavender) alone generate $32K/month—small improvements have big impact

## The Solution: Dual-Track Optimization Program

We propose a **systematic, data-driven program** that addresses BOTH root causes:

**Track 1: Traffic Quality Optimization (NEW)**
- Shift keyword strategy from informational → commercial/transactional
- Target B2B bulk buyers, not B2C wellness seekers
- Build authority for "wholesale", "bulk supplier", "private label" keywords
- Improve CTR from 1.20% → 2.5%+ with better-targeted content

**Track 2: Product Page Optimization (Enhanced)**
- Optimize 4-5 product pages per month (prioritized by revenue)
- A/B test variations to validate improvements  
- Mobile-first design (addresses 85% bounce rate)
- Trust signals and conversion optimization

### Core Focus Areas

1. **Commercial SEO & Traffic Quality** (NEW Priority)
   - B2B keyword gap analysis and targeting
   - Shift from informational (90%) → commercial/transactional (40%+)
   - Target "bulk supplier", "wholesale", "private label" keywords
   - Improve organic CTR from 1.20% → 2.5%+
   - Build B2B authority content and technical specs
   
2. **Product Page Redesign & Testing**
   - Optimize 4-5 product pages per month (prioritized by revenue)
   - A/B test variations to validate improvements
   - Mobile-first design (addresses 85% bounce rate)
   
3. **Trust Signal Implementation**

5. **Site Performance**
   - Page speed optimization (faster = better engagement)
   - Core Web Vitals improvements
   - Mobile experience enhancement

### What This Is NOT

This is **not** generic "conversion rate optimization" or "SEO services." This is a laser-focused program to solve your specific problem: attracting the RIGHT visitors and getting them to add products to cart.

**Out of Scope:**
- ❌ Checkout optimization (already performing at 53.3%)
- ❌ Paid advertising management
- ❌ Email marketing execution
- ❌ Product photography (we provide direction only)
- ❌ Social media management
