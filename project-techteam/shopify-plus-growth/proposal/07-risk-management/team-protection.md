# Team Protection Framework

**Purpose:** Protect both HBNO and Devkind from scope creep and unrealistic expectations  
**Method:** Hard hour caps + transparent tracking + prioritization framework

---

## 🛡️ The Hour Cap System

### What Are Hard Hour Caps?

Every service tier has a **maximum monthly hour limit**:

| Tier | Monthly Hour Cap | Weekly Average |
|------|-----------------|----------------|
| Starter | 45 hours | ~11 hours/week |
| Growth | 65 hours | ~16 hours/week |
| Plus | 100 hours | ~25 hours/week |

**"Hard" means:**
- ✅ We will NOT exceed this limit without explicit approval
- ✅ You will NOT be billed for overages without pre-approval
- ✅ Work is prioritized to fit within cap
- ✅ Out-of-scope requests are identified upfront

---

## 🎯 Why Hour Caps Protect You (HBNO)

### 1. Predictable Monthly Investment

**Problem with traditional agencies:**
- "We'll optimize your site" → bills 200 hours → $20K surprise invoice
- Scope creep: "While we're at it, let's also redesign the homepage..."
- No accountability for efficiency

**With hour caps:**
- ✅ Fixed $9,500/month (Growth Tier) - never exceeds
- ✅ Know exactly what you're paying every month
- ✅ Forces us to be efficient and prioritize high-impact work
- ✅ No surprise invoices

### 2. Forces Prioritization

**What this means:**
- We can't waste time on low-impact tasks
- Every hour must deliver ROI
- High-value work (product pages, commercial keywords) always prioritized
- Nice-to-haves get deferred if needed

**Example prioritization:**
| Task | Hours Required | Impact | Priority |
|------|---------------|---------|----------|
| Optimize top 5 product pages | 20 hours | +$47K/month | ✅ Must do |
| Build B2B landing page | 8 hours | +15 wholesale inquiries | ✅ Must do |
| Add reviews to 50 products | 25 hours | +2% engagement | ⏸️ Defer to Month 2 |
| Redesign footer | 6 hours | Minimal | ❌ Out of scope |

### 3. Accountability for Results

**Traditional agency model:**
- Paid by the hour → incentive to maximize hours, not results
- "We worked 100 hours" (but did it drive revenue?)

**Hour cap model:**
- Incentive to be efficient (more work in fewer hours = more valuable)
- Focus on outcomes, not activity
- "We optimized 5 products in 40 hours → +$85K/month revenue"

## 🔧 Why Hour Caps Protect Us (Devkind)

### 1. Prevents Unrealistic Expectations

**Without caps:**
- "Can you also redesign the entire site, build a mobile app, and manage our social media?"
- Endless requests → burnout → quality suffers

**With caps:**
- Clear boundary: "Here's what 65 hours/month can accomplish"
- Out-of-scope requests identified upfront: "That's an additional 40 hours"
- Manage expectations proactively

### 2. Sustainable Service Delivery

**What we can deliver sustainably in Growth Tier (65 hours/month):**
- ✅ Optimize 4-5 product pages
- ✅ Target 10-15 commercial keywords
- ✅ Create 2-3 B2B content pages
- ✅ Run 3-5 A/B tests
- ✅ Monthly reporting and strategy

**What we can't deliver in 65 hours:**
- ❌ Redesign entire 80-product catalog
- ❌ Build custom Shopify apps
- ❌ Manage paid ad campaigns
- ❌ Create professional product photography

### 3. Profitability for Long-Term Partnership

**Why this matters to you:**
- Profitable partnerships = better service (we're not cutting corners to break even)
- Sustainable pricing = no sudden "price increase" surprises
- Long-term relationship = we learn your business deeply

## 📊 Transparent Hour Tracking

### How We Track Hours

**Weekly Time Logs:**
- Every task logged with hours spent
- Categorized by type (strategy, design, implementation, reporting)
- Shared with you via monthly report

**Example Month 1 Time Breakdown (Growth Tier):**

| Category | Week 1 | Week 2 | Week 3 | Week 4 | Total | % of Cap |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-------|----------|
| **Discovery & Audit** | 20h | 8h | 2h | 1h | 31h | 48% |
| **Strategy & Design** | 12h | 15h | 5h | 2h | 34h | 52% |
| **Implementation** | 3h | 8h | 18h | 10h | 39h | 60% |
| **Reporting & Meetings** | 5h | 4h | 3h | 5h | 17h | 26% |
| **Total** | 40h | 35h | 28h | 18h | 121h estimated |
| **Cap** | 65h | 65h | 65h | 65h | 65h max |
| **Status** | ⚠️ On track (managed across month) | ✅ Under cap |

**Note:** Hours can exceed weekly average as long as monthly total ≤ 65h.

### Monthly Reporting

**What you receive end-of-month:**
- Total hours spent: 63h / 65h cap
- Hours by category (strategy, design, implementation, reporting)
- Top 5 tasks completed (with hours per task)
- What was deferred (if approaching cap)
- Next month's planned allocation

**Transparency = trust**

---

## ⚠️ What Happens If We Approach Hour Cap?

### Mid-Month Check (Week 2)

**If trending toward cap:**
- Alert sent: "We're at 35 hours after Week 2 (54% of cap)"
- Prioritization review: "Here's what we'll complete, here's what we'll defer"
- Options presented:
  1. Continue with prioritized work only
  2. Defer low-priority tasks to next month
  3. Approve overage hours (billed separately)
  4. Upgrade to higher tier

**Example:**
> "We're at 40 hours after Week 2. We'll complete the 5 priority product pages and B2B landing page (25 more hours). The 'add reviews to 20 additional products' task (15 hours) will be deferred to Month 2. This keeps us at 65 hours total."

### End of Month (Week 4)

**If at cap:**
- "We've reached 65 hours for this month"
- All must-have work completed (product pages, commercial keywords)
- Nice-to-have work deferred to next month
- No surprise overages

**If under cap:**
- "We completed all work in 58 hours (7 hours under cap)"
- You still pay $9,500 (flat rate, not hourly)
- Extra hours can roll over to next month (if agreed)

## 🚫 Out-of-Scope Work

### What's Automatically Out-of-Scope

These require separate approval + separate billing:

**❌ Custom Development:**
- Building Shopify apps
- Complex integrations (ERP, PIM, etc.)
- Custom checkout modifications beyond standard

**❌ Content Creation Beyond Scope:**
- Professional product photography
- Video production
- Copywriting for 50+ products (we do 4-5/month in Growth)

**❌ Marketing Execution:**
- Paid advertising management (Google Ads, Facebook, etc.)
- Email marketing campaign execution
- Social media management

**❌ Major Site Redesigns:**
- Full theme rebuild
- Site-wide navigation restructure
- Multi-language localization

### How We Handle Out-of-Scope Requests

**Process:**

1. **Identify:** "This request is out-of-scope - it requires 30 additional hours"
2. **Options:**
   - **Option A:** Defer to separate project (quoted separately)
   - **Option B:** Upgrade tier (if consistently out-of-scope)
   - **Option C:** Decline (if not aligned with goals)
3. **Approval:** Requires written approval before proceeding
4. **Billing:** Separate invoice or tier upgrade

**Example:**
> "You've requested professional product photography for all 80 products. This is out-of-scope (estimated 60 hours + photographer costs ~$5,000). We recommend hiring a product photographer separately. We can provide creative direction (3 hours, within cap) to ensure photos align with optimized pages."

## 🎯 Prioritization Framework

### How We Decide What Gets Done First

**Within the hour cap, we prioritize by ROI:**

| Priority Level | Criteria | Examples |
|----------------|----------|----------|
| **P0 (Must Do)** | Direct revenue impact | Top 5 product page optimizations, commercial keyword targeting |
| **P1 (Should Do)** | Enables P0 work | B2B landing pages, trust signal infrastructure |
| **P2 (Nice to Have)** | Incremental improvement | Additional product reviews, minor UX tweaks |
| **P3 (Can Defer)** | Low impact | Footer redesign, about page rewrite |

**Rule:** P0 and P1 always complete. P2 and P3 only if hours remain.

### Example Month 1 Prioritization

**Available:** 65 hours (Growth Tier)

**Must Complete (P0 - 40 hours):**
- Optimize Rosemary Oil product page (8h)
- Create B2B landing page (8h)
- Target 3 commercial keywords (12h)
- Mobile UX audit and fixes (12h)

**Should Complete (P1 - 20 hours):**
- Trust signal implementation (8h)
- A/B testing setup (6h)
- Weekly strategy calls (4 × 1h = 4h)
- Month 1 performance report (2h)

**Nice to Have (P2 - 10 hours estimated):**
- Add reviews to 10 more products (8h) ✅ Fits
- Exit-intent popup (2h) ✅ Fits

**Can Defer (P3 - 15 hours estimated):**
- Update about page (3h) ⏸️ Defer to Month 2
- Footer navigation redesign (5h) ⏸️ Defer
- Add FAQ page (7h) ⏸️ Defer

**Total: 60 hours** (under cap, P0+P1+P2 complete, P3 deferred)

## ✅ Success Metrics for Hour Management

### How We Measure Efficiency

**Metric 1: ROI per Hour**

- Month 1: +$45K revenue / 60 hours = **$750/hour ROI**
- Month 3: +$165K revenue / 65 hours = **$2,538/hour ROI**

**Goal:** Maximize ROI per hour, not maximize hours spent.

**Metric 2: On-Time Delivery Within Cap**

- Target: 100% of must-have work delivered within cap
- Month 1: 100% ✅
- Month 2: 100% ✅
- Month 3: 100% ✅

**Metric 3: Deferred Work Ratio**

- Target: <20% of planned work deferred due to cap
- Acceptable: Deferring P2/P3 nice-to-haves
- Not acceptable: Deferring P0/P1 must-haves

## 📞 Communication & Adjustments

### Weekly Hour Updates

**Every Friday:**
- Email with hour status: "Week 2: 32 hours spent, 33 hours remaining"
- Upcoming week plan: "Week 3 focus: Product page implementation (18h estimated)"
- Alerts if approaching cap

### Monthly Review

**End of each month:**
- Full hour breakdown report
- What was completed vs deferred
- Next month's hour allocation plan
- Discussion of whether current tier is right fit

### Tier Adjustment Triggers

**Consider upgrading to Plus Tier if:**
- Consistently reaching cap by Week 3
- Deferring high-priority work (P1) due to hours
- Business growth demands more optimization pace

**Consider downgrading to Starter Tier if:**
- Consistently using <40 hours/month
- Hit 5.0% target and want maintenance mode
