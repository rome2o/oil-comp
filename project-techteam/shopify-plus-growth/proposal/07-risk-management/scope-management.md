## 🔄 Change Request Process

### How to Request Scope Changes

**Step 1: Submit Written Request**

Use this format:
```
Change Request: [Title]
Requested by: [Name]
Date: [Date]

Description:
[What you want to change/add]

Business Justification:
[Why this is important]

Estimated Impact:
[How this affects timeline/budget]
```

**Step 2: Impact Assessment**

We evaluate:
- **Hours Required:** How many hours will this take?
- **Priority:** Is this P0 (must-have) or P2 (nice-to-have)?
- **Timeline Impact:** Does this delay other work?
- **Cost:** Does this require tier upgrade or separate billing?

**Step 3: Proposal & Approval**

We respond with:
- Feasibility assessment
- Hour estimate
- Options:
  - **Option A:** Include in current tier (if hours available)
  - **Option B:** Defer to next month
  - **Option C:** Upgrade tier
  - **Option D:** Separate project (billed separately)

**Step 4: Execute (If Approved)**

- Written approval required before proceeding
- Update roadmap and hour allocation
- Track hours against change request

## 📋 Scope Clarification Examples

### Example 1: "Can you also redesign our homepage?"

**Request:** Redesign homepage with new layout

**Assessment:**
- Hours required: 25-30 hours
- Current tier capacity: Growth Tier (65h/month)
- Already allocated: 60 hours for product pages + SEO
- Impact: Would exceed cap

**Response:**
> "Homepage redesign is out-of-scope for product page optimization program. It requires 25-30 hours which exceeds current cap. Options:
> 1. Separate project - quoted at $4,500 (separate from retainer)
> 2. Upgrade to Plus Tier ($15,000/month) which has 100h capacity
> 3. Defer to Month 4 after product page work completes
>
> Our recommendation: Option 3 - focus on product pages first (higher ROI), then homepage in Month 4."

### Example 2: "Can you add reviews to all 80 products?"

**Request:** Add customer reviews to entire catalog

**Assessment:**
- Hours required: 40 hours (80 products × 0.5h each)
- Current allocation: 4-5 products/month in Growth Tier
- Timeline: 16-20 months at current pace

**Response:**
> "Adding reviews to all 80 products is feasible but requires prioritization. Options:
> 1. Current pace: 4-5 products/month (covered in Growth Tier) - 16 months
> 2. Accelerated: Upgrade to Plus Tier (8-10 products/month) - 8 months
> 3. Bulk implementation: Separate project for all 80 at once - $6,000 one-time
>
> Our recommendation: Option 1 - prioritize high-revenue products first (top 20 = 80% of revenue) in 4 months, defer long-tail."

### Example 3: "We want to add international shipping options"

**Request:** Implement multi-currency and international shipping

**Assessment:**
- Complexity: High (Shopify Markets, currency conversion, tax compliance)
- Hours required: 50-60 hours
- Expertise: Requires Shopify Plus specialist
- Out-of-scope: Not product page optimization

**Response:**
> "International expansion is strategic but out-of-scope for product page optimization. This requires separate project with Shopify Markets expertise. Options:
> 1. We can refer you to Shopify Plus partner specializing in international - estimated $8K-12K
> 2. We can provide strategy consultation (5 hours within cap) to help plan approach
> 3. If you prioritize this over product optimization, we can pivot program focus (requires redefined scope)
>
> Our recommendation: Complete 90-day product page optimization first (+$165K/month), then invest those gains into international expansion (Q1 2026)."

## 🚦 Scope Adherence Rules

### Red Flags: Automatic Out-of-Scope

These require separate approval:

🚫 **"While you're at it, can you also..."**
- Scope creep indicator
- Requires impact assessment first

🚫 **"This should be quick..."**
- Often not quick
- Requires hour estimate before proceeding

🚫 **"We need this ASAP by end of week..."**
- Rush work may exceed cap
- May require rush fee (1.5x rate)

🚫 **"Can you manage our [channel] too?"**
- Different expertise area
- Requires separate engagement

### Green Lights: Likely In-Scope

These can typically be accommodated:

✅ **"Can you optimize [Product X] instead of [Product Y]?"**
- Simple reprioritization
- No hour impact

✅ **"Can you test [Button Color A] vs [Button Color B]?"**
- Part of A/B testing scope
- Within allocated hours

✅ **"Can you add [Trust Badge X] we just received?"**
- Part of trust signal implementation
- Minimal hours

✅ **"Can you analyze [Metric X] in next report?"**
- Part of reporting scope
- Minimal effort

## 🔑 Key Principles

### 1. Scope Protects the Program

**Narrow scope = Deep impact**
- Better to excel at product page optimization than be mediocre at everything
- Focus = Results

### 2. Transparency = Trust

**No hidden "that's out-of-scope" surprises**
- Everything documented upfront
- Gray areas clarified proactively
- You know what you're paying for

### 3. Flexibility Within Boundaries

**We're not rigid:**
- Reprioritization within scope: Always okay
- Minor adjustments: Usually accommodated
- Major changes: Discussed openly

**But we have boundaries:**
- Out-of-scope = separate approval
- Over-cap = explicit agreement
- Rush work = premium pricing

### 4. Business Justification Required

**Every request evaluated by impact:**
- Will this drive revenue?
- Does this support the core goal (add-to-cart optimization)?
- Is this the highest-priority use of hours?

**Low-impact requests politely declined:**
> "We could do that, but it won't move the needle on add-to-cart rate. Instead, let's focus on [higher-impact task]."
