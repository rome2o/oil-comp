## 📊 Scoring Methodology

### How We Rank Initiatives

**Formula:**
```
Priority Score = (Impact × Confidence) ÷ Effort
```

**Impact (1-10):**
- Expected revenue lift ($K/month)
- Based on data analysis and industry benchmarks

**Confidence (1-10):**
- How certain we are of achieving impact
- Based on past client results and test data

**Effort (1-10):**
- Time, resources, complexity required
- Lower effort = higher score (more efficient)

**Priority Score (0-10):**
- >9.0: CRITICAL (must-do, high ROI)
- 7.0-8.9: HIGH (strong ROI, prioritize)
- 5.0-6.9: MEDIUM (good ROI, backlog)
- <5.0: LOW (nice-to-have, defer)

### 2. Commercial Keyword Targeting (HIGH)

**Priority Score: 8.8/10**

**Impact: 9/10**
- Revenue lift: +$50K/month (stacks with Priority 1)
- Traffic quality shift: 50% hobbyists → 70% commercial buyers
- Higher intent visitors = higher conversion

**Confidence: 8.5/10**
- Keyword gap analysis shows clear opportunity
- Competitors ranking for B2B terms (you're not)
- Commercial keywords have lower competition

**Effort: 8.7/10 (Moderate Effort)**
- 4-6 weeks to see ranking improvements
- Requires content creation (landing pages)
- Ongoing optimization (monthly)

**Why This Matters:**

**Current Traffic Breakdown:**
- 50% DIY/aromatherapy hobbyists (low intent)
- 30% general "essential oils" searches (mixed intent)
- 20% commercial/B2B buyers (high intent)

**Target Traffic Breakdown (After Optimization):**
- 70% commercial/B2B buyers
- 20% general searches
- 10% hobbyists (filtered out)

**Keyword Opportunities (Ranked by Priority):**

**Tier 1: High-Volume, Low-Competition**
- "bulk essential oils wholesale" (480 searches/month, KD: 25)
- "essential oils for manufacturing" (320 searches/month, KD: 22)
- "organic essential oils supplier" (290 searches/month, KD: 28)

**Tier 2: Moderate Volume, High Intent**
- "GC/MS tested essential oils" (180 searches/month, KD: 18)
- "therapeutic grade oils bulk" (210 searches/month, KD: 30)
- "essential oils for spas" (150 searches/month, KD: 20)

**Tier 3: Long-Tail, Very High Intent**
- "rosemary oil 16oz wholesale" (50 searches/month, KD: 10)
- "lavender oil gallon price" (40 searches/month, KD: 8)
- "bulk tea tree oil for soap making" (35 searches/month, KD: 12)

**Expected Results (90 Days):**
- 10-12 keywords ranking page 1
- +3,000 monthly visitors (commercial intent)
- +$30-50K/month revenue (stacked with Priority 1)

**Integration with Priority 1:**
- Commercial landing pages feed into optimized product pages
- Higher intent traffic = higher conversion on new pages
- Compound effect: 5.0% conversion on better traffic = exponential lift

---

### 3. Mobile UX Enhancement (HIGH)

**Priority Score: 8.2/10**

**Impact: 8/10**
- 60% of traffic is mobile (7,500 visitors/month)
- Mobile add-to-cart: 1.5% (vs 2.8% desktop)
- Closing mobile gap = +$40K/month

**Confidence: 8/10**
- Clear mobile performance issues (page speed, UX)
- Mobile-first design is proven best practice
- Easy to A/B test mobile-specific changes

**Effort: 8.5/10 (Lower Effort)**
- Included in product page optimization (Priority 1)
- Mobile-first design approach (not separate project)
- 2-3 weeks per page (5 pages = 10-15 weeks)

**Why Mobile Matters:**

**Current Mobile Performance:**
- 60% of traffic (7,500 visits/month)
- 1.5% add-to-cart (vs 2.8% desktop = -46%)
- Average load time: 4.2 seconds (target: <3 sec)
- Bounce rate: 52% (vs 38% desktop)

**Mobile-Specific Issues:**

1. **Layout Problems:**
   - Product images too small (not optimized for vertical scroll)
   - "Add to Cart" button below fold (requires scrolling)
   - Trust signals buried (reviews, certifications)

2. **Touch Target Issues:**
   - Buttons too small (40px, should be 48px minimum)
   - Image gallery doesn't swipe naturally
   - Dropdown menus hard to select

3. **Performance Issues:**
   - Large image files (not mobile-optimized)
   - Unminified CSS/JS (slow load times)
   - No lazy loading (loads all content upfront)

4. **Content Density:**
   - Too much text (desktop copy on mobile)
   - No progressive disclosure (everything shown at once)
   - Form fields too small (shipping address entry)

**Mobile Optimization Plan:**

**Design Changes:**
- Larger product images (full-width hero)
- Sticky "Add to Cart" button (always visible)
- Reviews above fold (first thing you see)
- Simplified navigation (hamburger menu)

**Technical Changes:**
- Image compression (WebP format, lazy loading)
- Minify CSS/JS (reduce file sizes)
- AMP pages (if feasible, or Shopify Turbo)
- Touch target optimization (48px minimum)

**Expected Results:**
- Mobile add-to-cart: 1.5% → 4.0% (+167%)
- Mobile bounce rate: 52% → 42% (-19%)
- Page load time: 4.2s → 2.8s (-33%)
- Revenue lift: +$40K/month (mobile-specific)

**Note:** Mobile optimization is INCLUDED in Priority 1 (Product Page Optimization). Not a separate initiative.

### 4. Cart Recovery Automation (MEDIUM)

**Priority Score: 6.5/10**

**Impact: 6/10**
- Revenue lift: +$20K/month
- Recovers 10-15% of abandoned carts
- Lower impact than fixing product pages

**Confidence: 7.5/10**
- Proven tactic (60-70% of e-commerce stores use)
- Clear data (173 checkouts/month, 73 purchases = 100 abandonments)
- Email automation is low-risk

**Effort: 7/10 (Moderate)**
- 2-3 weeks to implement
- Requires email sequence creation (3-5 emails)
- Klaviyo or similar platform integration

**Why Lower Priority:**

**Math:**
- Current: 173 checkouts/month, 73 purchases (42% completion)
- Abandoned: 100 carts/month
- With cart recovery (10% success): +10 purchases/month
- Revenue lift: 10 × $1,645 AOV = +$16K/month

**Comparison:**
- Cart recovery: +$16K/month (6.5x ROI)
- Product page optimization: +$165K/month (17.4x ROI)
- **Product pages are 10x higher impact**

**When to Pursue:**
- AFTER fixing product pages (Priority 1)
- When you have 500+ abandonments/month (scale matters)
- If easy win (you already have Klaviyo setup)

**Recommended Approach (If Pursued):**

**3-Email Sequence:**
1. **Email 1 (1 hour after abandonment):** "You left something behind"
2. **Email 2 (24 hours):** "Still interested? Here's 10% off"
3. **Email 3 (3 days):** "Last chance - your cart expires soon"

**Expected Results:**
- 10-15% cart recovery rate
- +10-15 purchases/month
- +$16-25K/month revenue

**Verdict:** Good initiative, but defer until AFTER Priority 1 is complete. Don't optimize downstream when upstream is broken.

### 5. Homepage Redesign (LOW)

**Priority Score: 4.2/10**

**Impact: 3/10**
- Revenue lift: +$5-10K/month
- Low impact because most traffic bypasses homepage
- 75% of visitors land on product pages (SEO)

**Confidence: 5/10**
- Homepage changes rarely move needle for e-commerce
- Hard to measure impact (attribution unclear)
- Risk: Wastes time on low-leverage activity

**Effort: 3/10 (High Effort = Low Score)**
- 4-6 weeks to redesign
- Requires stakeholder alignment (subjective design opinions)
- A/B testing homepage is complex (attribution issues)

**Why This is Low Priority:**

**Traffic Patterns:**
- Only 25% of visitors land on homepage
- 75% land directly on product pages (Google search)
- Homepage optimization = optimizing for 25% of traffic

**Math:**
- 4,167 homepage visits/month (25% of 16,667 total)
- Current homepage → product page click-through: 60%
- Even if we improve to 80% (+20%): Only +833 product page views
- At 2.03% add-to-cart: +17 add-to-carts
- Revenue lift: 17 × $1,645 × 42% × 68% = +$8K/month

**Comparison:**
- Homepage redesign: +$8K/month (4.2x ROI, 6 weeks)
- Product page optimization: +$165K/month (17.4x ROI, 12 weeks)
- **Product pages are 20x higher impact in same time**

**When to Pursue:**
- AFTER product pages and traffic quality are optimized
- If you start running paid ads (then homepage matters more)
- If brand refresh is needed (separate from conversion optimization)

**Verdict:** Nice-to-have, not must-have. Defer indefinitely in favor of higher-leverage work.

---

## 🚫 Anti-Priorities: What NOT to Do

### Common Traps to Avoid

**❌ Anti-Priority 1: Paid Ads (Before Fixing Conversion)**
- Why it fails: Drives traffic to broken product pages (2.03% conversion)
- Cost: $5,000/month ad spend × 2.03% = minimal ROI
- Better: Fix product pages FIRST (5.0% conversion), THEN run ads

**❌ Anti-Priority 2: Checkout Optimization**
- Why it fails: Checkout is already strong (68% cart-to-checkout, 42% purchase)
- Focus: Fix product pages (only 2.03% get to checkout)
- Rule: Don't optimize downstream when upstream is broken

**❌ Anti-Priority 3: Blog Content Creation**
- Why it fails: SEO takes 6-12 months, low commercial intent
- Focus: Commercial keywords with buying intent (faster ROI)
- Rule: Content marketing is long-term play, not 90-day win

**❌ Anti-Priority 4: App Installations (Random Tools)**
- Why it fails: Tools don't fix strategic problems
- Common trap: "Let's try this popup app, this quiz app, this..."
- Focus: Strategy first, tools second (we'll recommend what's needed)

**❌ Anti-Priority 5: Perfectionism (Over-Polishing)**
- Why it fails: Diminishing returns, analysis paralysis
- Example: 20 hours to perfect one product image (negligible impact)
- Focus: Ship, test, iterate (A/B testing beats guessing)

---
