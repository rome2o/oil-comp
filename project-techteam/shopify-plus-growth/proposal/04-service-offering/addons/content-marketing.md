## When to Add: Month 6+ (After Foundation Complete)

**Don't add content marketing too early.** Here's why:

❌ **Before Month 6:**
- Product/industry pages incomplete (dilutes focus)
- Video content before written content drives traffic (expensive, lower ROI)
- Lead magnets before email foundation built (no list to nurture)

✅ **After Month 6:**
- Core optimization complete (products, industries, collections)
- Traffic quality improving from commercial keywords
- Email list growing from RFQ forms
- Ready to dominate long-tail keywords
