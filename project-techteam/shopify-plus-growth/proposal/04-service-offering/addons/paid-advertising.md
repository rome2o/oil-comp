## When to Add: Month 6-12 (After Conversion Rates Stabilized)

**Why wait?** Paid ads amplify your conversion rates—good or bad:

❌ **Before Month 6:**
- Amplifying low conversion rates = wasted ad spend
- Poor product pages = high CPC, low Quality Scores
- Weak organic foundation = higher costs

✅ **After Month 6-12:**
- Conversion rates 3%+ (optimized product pages)
- Quality traffic from organic (cheaper CPA benchmarks)
- Clear understanding of what converts
- Ready to scale profitably

- Campaign strategy & setup
- Ad creative & copywriting
- Ongoing optimization & testing
- Landing page recommendations

## Frequently Asked Questions

### "Can I start with $1,000/month ad spend?"

**Not recommended.** Here's why:
- Insufficient data for optimization (need 100+ conversions/month for statistical significance)
- Limited testing capacity (can't test multiple campaigns)
- Higher CPCs (smaller budgets = less competitive bids)

**Minimum $3,000/month** recommended for any meaningful results.

### "What's the difference between management fee and ad spend?"

- **Management Fee ($4,500-7,500/month):** Strategy, setup, optimization, reporting (our service)
- **Ad Spend ($3,000-10,000/month):** Money paid directly to Google, LinkedIn, Facebook (goes to platforms)

**Example:** $5,500 management fee + $5,000 ad spend = $10,500/month total investment

### "How long until I see results?"

**Timeline:**
- **Week 1-2:** Campaign setup & launch
- **Week 3-4:** Initial data collection
- **Month 2:** Optimization based on data
- **Month 3+:** Profitable scaling

**Expect 60-90 days** to reach profitable ROAS. Don't judge performance in first 30 days.

### "Can you guarantee a specific ROAS?"

**No.** ROAS depends on:
- Your conversion rates (optimize first)
- Your average order value (higher AOV = better ROAS)
- Your profit margins (B2B wholesale margins)
- Industry competition (CPCs vary)

**We target 3-5x ROAS**, but can't guarantee specific numbers.

### "What if ads don't perform?"

**Our approach:**
1. **Month 1:** Test multiple campaigns, identify winners
2. **Month 2:** Pause underperformers, scale winners
3. **Month 3:** Optimize based on data

**If ROAS <2x after 90 days**, we recommend:
- Pause ads, revisit conversion rate optimization
- Adjust product pricing or positioning
- Focus on organic growth until fundamentals improve

**No long-term lock-in.** Cancel anytime with 30-day notice.
