# Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO)

**Program:** Product Page Optimization  
**Client:** HBNO Essential Natural Oils

✅ **After Month 9-12:**
- Established traffic (1,000+ visitors/month minimum)
- Product/industry pages optimized
- Baseline conversion rates measured
- Ready for advanced full-funnel optimization

## Starting at $5,500/month

**What's Included:**
- Full-funnel A/B testing strategy
- Heat mapping & session recording analysis
- User behavior analysis
- Conversion roadblock identification
- Hypothesis generation & prioritization
- Monthly testing reports

## Frequently Asked Questions

### "How much traffic do I need for CRO testing?"

**Minimum:** 1,000 visitors/month + 15 conversions/month
- Lower traffic = slower test results (3-6 months per test)

**Ideal:** 5,000+ visitors/month + 75+ conversions/month
- Faster test results (4-8 weeks per test)
- More reliable data

**If traffic is low:** Focus on traffic growth first (SEO, content, ads) before adding CRO.

### "Can I do CRO in-house?"

**Yes**, but consider:
- **Tools cost:** Hotjar ($80-400/month), VWO ($600-2,000/month), design tools
- **Expertise required:** Statistical significance, test design, UX principles
- **Time required:** 40-60 hours/month (analysis, design, setup, monitoring)

**Hybrid model:** We provide strategy & setup, you monitor & implement (reduced fee: $3,500/month)

### "What's the difference between base A/B testing and CRO service?"

| Feature | Base Program (Included) | CRO Add-On Service |
|---------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| **Testing scope** | Product pages only | Full-funnel (all pages) |
| **Test volume** | 2-3 tests total (90 days) | 2-6 tests/month ongoing |
| **Heat mapping** | Not included | Included |
| **Session recording** | Not included | Included |
| **Advanced segmentation** | Not included | Included |
| **Personalization** | Not included | Tier 2-3 only |

**Base program** = foundational optimization.  
**CRO add-on** = advanced, ongoing optimization.

### "How do you prioritize what to test?"

**PIE Framework (Potential × Importance × Ease):**
- **Potential:** How much improvement is possible?
- **Importance:** How much traffic/revenue does this page drive?
- **Ease:** How quickly can we test this?

**Prioritize high-PIE score tests first** (high impact, low effort).

### "What if a test fails (no winner)?"

**Learning is the goal.** Failed tests teach us:
- What NOT to do (valuable insight)
- User preferences (guides future tests)
- Areas to investigate further

**No test is truly a failure** if we learn from it. Typical win rate: 30-40% of tests show significant improvement.
