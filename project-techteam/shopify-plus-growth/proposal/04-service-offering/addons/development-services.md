## When to Add: After Core Optimization Complete

**Why wait?** Custom development delivers higher ROI **after foundation is solid**:

❌ **Before Core Optimization:**
- Building custom features before basic optimization = wasted investment
- Complex tools without traffic = no users
- Expensive features before conversion rates stabilized = amplifying problems

✅ **After Core Optimization:**
- Traffic quality established
- Conversion rates stabilized
- Clear user needs identified from data
- Ready to scale with custom features

## Frequently Asked Questions

### "Can development work happen alongside optimization?"

**Yes**, but with caution:
- **Small projects** (<$10,000): Minimal disruption, can run in parallel
- **Large projects** ($20,000+): May require additional resources or phased timeline

**Recommendation:** Complete core optimization first (Months 1-6), then add development.

### "What if scope changes mid-project?"

**Change request process:**
1. Document requested change
2. Assess impact on timeline & cost
3. Provide change order quote
4. Your approval required before proceeding

**No surprise charges.** All changes transparent and approved in advance.

### "Do you build on Shopify Plus, or just Shopify?"

**Both.**
- **Shopify:** Most custom app & integration projects
- **Shopify Plus:** Enterprise features (B2B portal, multi-currency, advanced checkout)

**Shopify Plus required** for some advanced features. We'll advise if upgrade needed.

**Likely yes.** We've integrated with:
- NetSuite, SAP, Microsoft Dynamics (ERP)
- Salesforce, HubSpot, Pipedrive (CRM)

- Custom APIs and proprietary systems

**Discovery call** determines integration feasibility and complexity.

1. **Ongoing Support Retainer:** $1,500-3,000/month for continued enhancements
2. **New Project Quotes:** Quote each new feature as a separate project
3. **On-Demand Support:** $175/hour for ad-hoc needs
