## When to Upgrade: Jonida's "2 Requests Per Week" (~8-10/month)

If you consistently need **more than 4 requests/month**, you have three options:

---

## Option 1: Extended Technical Support ⭐ RECOMMENDED

**+$2,500/month**

**What You Get:**
- **12 additional requests/month** (total: 16 requests with base)
- Priority response time: **12-24 hours**
- Dedicated technical contact
- Monthly technical review call

**Best For:**
- Businesses with frequent technical needs (8-10+ requests/month)
- Active development & optimization happening simultaneously
- Teams needing predictable support capacity

**Example Monthly Usage:**
- Week 1: 2 requests (product uploads + app configuration)
- Week 2: 3 requests (form update + 2 page fixes)
- Week 3: 2 requests (NetSuite troubleshooting + theme tweak)
- Week 4: 3 requests (seasonal updates + menu changes)
- **Total:** 10 requests (within 16 limit, with buffer)

**Total Investment:** $14,000/month

---

## Option 2: On-Demand Request Blocks

**Pre-purchase blocks (no monthly commitment)**

| Block Size | Cost | Expires | Per-Request Cost | Best For |
|------------|------|---------|------------------|----------|
| **10 requests** | $1,750 | 90 days | $175/request | Occasional heavy months |
| **20 requests** | $3,000 | 180 days | $150/request | Sporadic needs, seasonal prep |

**How It Works:**
1. Pre-purchase a block of requests
2. Use them as needed over expiration period
3. Track usage in ClickUp (transparent visibility)
4. No recurring monthly charge

**Best For:**
- Unpredictable technical needs
- Seasonal businesses (ramp up Q4, slow Q1)
- Testing before committing to monthly retainer
- One-off projects (annual site updates, seasonal campaigns)

**Example Use Case:**
- Purchase 10-request block in October ($1,750)
- Use 6 requests for Q4 holiday prep
- Use 4 requests in November/December for seasonal changes
- No ongoing monthly commitment

**Average Investment:** ~$12,000-12,500/month (base + blocks as needed)

## Recommended Package for Jonida's Business

Based on "2 requests per week" = ~8-10 requests/month:

### Option A: Base + Extended Tech Support ⭐ RECOMMENDED

**$14,000/month**

**Why This Works:**
- Handles current technical request volume (8-10/month)
- Buffer capacity for seasonal spikes (Q4 holiday prep)
- Predictable monthly investment
- No overage anxiety

---

### Option B: Base + On-Demand Blocks

**~$12,000-12,500/month average**

**Why This Works:**
- Lower average cost than monthly retainer
- Flexibility for variable request volume
- Good if request volume decreases after initial setup

---

### Option C: Start Base, Scale as Needed

**$11,500/month initially**

**Why This Works:**
- Lowest initial commitment
- Real data drives decision to scale (Month 1-2)
- Add Extended Tech Support in Month 3 if consistently hitting limit

**Risk:** May hit 4-request limit during heavy months

## Frequently Asked Questions

### "What if I need more than 4 requests in a month?"

Three options:
1. **Add Extended Tech Support** ($2,500/month) for 12 additional requests
2. **Purchase On-Demand Block** ($1,750 for 10 requests, use over 90 days)
3. **Wait until next month** (not ideal for urgent needs)

Most clients find 4 requests sufficient after initial setup (Months 1-2).

### "Can I change my support level mid-contract?"

**Yes.** You can:
- Add Extended Tech Support or Store Management starting next month (30-day notice)
- Purchase On-Demand Blocks anytime (immediate access)
- Upgrade/downgrade at quarterly reviews (no penalty)

### "How is this different from paying by the hour?"

You're paying for **outcomes**, not time:
- Each request gets completed regardless of time required
- No "this took 2.5 hours" invoices
- Predictable monthly investment
- No worry about efficiency—we optimize for results, not billable hours

**Example:** Installing an app might take 30 minutes or 3 hours (if troubleshooting needed). You pay the same—1 request.

### "Do unused requests roll over to next month?"

**No**, but we optimize to avoid waste:
- If you only use 2 of 4 requests, we'll suggest: "Want us to upload those new products now?"
- We proactively identify opportunities to use capacity
- **On-Demand Blocks DO roll over** (90-180 day expiration)

### "Can I pause service for a month?"

- **Base optimization:** 30-day notice, but not recommended (loses momentum)
- **Extended Tech Support:** Can pause with 30-day notice
- **Store Management:** 60-day notice (dedicated resource assigned)

**Better alternative:** Scale down to ~15 pages/month during slow periods.
