# Add-On Services & Expansion Options

**Program:** Product Page Optimization  
**Client:** HBNO Essential Natural Oils

## Why Add-On Services?

Your **$11,500/month base investment** focuses on what delivers immediate ROI:
- ~30 page optimizations per month (products, industries, collections)
- SEO cleanup & strategy
- A/B testing on key conversion points
- Up to 4 basic technical requests/month

**Focus drives results.** Spreading budget too thin dilutes impact.

These add-on services become valuable **after your foundation is established**—typically after 3-6 months when:
- Toxic backlinks cleaned up
- Top revenue pages optimized
- Traffic quality improving
- Conversion rates stabilizing

## What's NOT Recommended Early

❌ **Aggressive blog publishing** before product/industry pages complete (dilutes focus)  
❌ **Video content** before written content driving traffic (expensive, lower ROI initially)  
❌ **Lead magnets** before email foundation built (no list to nurture yet)  
❌ **Paid ads** before conversion rates stabilized (amplifies problems, not solutions)

**Let data guide expansion.** At quarterly reviews, we'll recommend which services to add based on performance.
