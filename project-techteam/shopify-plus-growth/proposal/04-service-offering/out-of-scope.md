# Out of Scope: What's NOT Included

**Clear Boundaries for Service Expectations**

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Document

**Why "Out of Scope" Matters:**
- Sets clear expectations (no surprises)
- Protects hour caps (focus on high-ROI work)
- Prevents scope creep (keeps timeline on track)
- Clarifies boundaries (know what to ask for separately)

**Principle:** We focus on organic traffic quality and product page conversion—activities that deliver 10.2x ROI in 90 days. Everything else is a distraction.

## 🔑 Key Principles

### Why Clear Scope Matters

**1. Protects Your Investment:**
- Hard hour caps prevent overspending
- Focused work = higher ROI
- No scope creep, no budget overruns

**2. Ensures On-Time Delivery:**
- 90-day timeline requires discipline
- Out-of-scope requests delay results
- Say no to low-ROI work, yes to revenue-driving work

**3. Sets Realistic Expectations:**
- You know exactly what you're getting
- No surprises, no disappointments
- Clear boundaries = healthy client relationship

**4. Maximizes ROI:**
- We focus on 10.2x ROI activities ONLY
- Everything else is distraction
- Optimize organic conversion first, expand channels later

## 🎯 Final Thoughts

**Our Philosophy:**
- Do LESS, better (focus beats breadth)
- Optimize core funnel first (organic traffic → product page → cart → purchase)
- Expand channels later (after proving model on Shopify)

**Your 90-Day Focus:**
- Traffic quality (B2B keywords)
- Product page conversion (2.03% → 5.0%)
- Mobile performance (60% of traffic)
- Nothing else matters until these are solved

**Phase 2 (Month 4+):**
- AFTER 90-day success, consider expansion:
  - Paid ads (Google, Facebook)
  - Email marketing (cart recovery, newsletters)
  - Content marketing (blog posts, long-term SEO)
  - Marketplace expansion (Amazon, Etsy)
  - International markets (multi-currency, translations)

**First, fix the foundation. Then, build the skyscraper.**
