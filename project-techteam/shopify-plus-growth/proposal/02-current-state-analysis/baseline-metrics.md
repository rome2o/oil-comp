# Current State Analysis: Baseline Metrics

**Client:** HBNO Essential Natural Oils  
**Analysis Period:** Last 30 days + SEO Performance (12 months)  
**Date:** November 14, 2025

---

## Executive Summary

HBNO's conversion funnel has a **critical bottleneck at the add-to-cart stage**, with only 2.03% of visitors engaging with products—far below the 8-10% industry standard. However, deeper analysis reveals this isn't just a product page problem: **90%+ of organic traffic has informational intent** rather than commercial/transactional intent, meaning the wrong audience is being attracted to the site.

**The Dual Problem:**
1. **Traffic Quality Crisis** - Attracting B2C wellness seekers instead of B2B bulk buyers
2. **Product Page Optimization Needs** - Lack of trust signals, mobile UX issues, weak CTAs

## E-Commerce Funnel Performance

### Current Performance (Last 30 Days)

| Metric | Value | Industry Benchmark | Status |
|--------|-------|-------------------|---------|
| **Total Sessions** | 36,490 | - | ✅ Healthy volume |
| **Added to Cart** | 739 (2.03%) | 8-10% | ❌ Critical issue |
| **Reached Checkout** | 393 (1.08%) | 4-5% | ⚠️ Below average |
| **Completed Orders** | 272 (0.72%) | 2-3% | ❌ Critical issue |
| **Checkout Conversion** | 53.3% | 40-50% | ✅ Excellent |
| **Monthly Revenue** | $120,000 | - | ✅ Healthy |
| **Average Order Value** | $441 | - | ✅ High-value orders |

### Funnel Visualization

```
36,490 Sessions (100%)
    ↓
739 Add to Cart (2.03%) ← CRITICAL BOTTLENECK
    ↓
393 Reached Checkout (53.2% of cart)
    ↓
272 Completed Purchase (69.2% of checkout) ← EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE
```

**Key Finding:** The funnel breaks down BEFORE the add-to-cart stage. Once customers engage with the checkout process, conversion rates are excellent (53.3%). The problem is getting visitors to engage with products in the first place.

## Traffic Quality Analysis

### SEO Performance Overview

| Metric | Current Value | Context |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| **Total Keywords Ranking** | 14,293 | Large footprint |
| **Monthly Organic Clicks** | ~3,700 | Growing (post-theme change) |
| **Average Position** | 23.3 | Improved 3.4% recently |
| **Click-Through Rate (CTR)** | **1.20%** | ❌ **78% decline** from previous 5.47% |
| **Impressions** | 453,053/month | +14.9% (post-theme) |
| **Branded Traffic** | **5.92%** | ⚠️ Weak brand awareness in B2B space |

### The Traffic Quality Crisis

**Keyword Intent Distribution (Top 50 Keywords):**

| Intent Type | % of Traffic | Example Keywords | Buyer Readiness |
|-------------|--------------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Informational** | **90%+** | "how to dilute tea tree oil for dogs" (1,400/mo)<br>"benefits of helichrysum oil" (3,300/mo)<br>"neem oil side effects"<br>"fall essential oil blends" (4,600/mo) | ❌ Zero purchase intent |
| **Commercial Investigation** | **5-10%** | "best body oil for dry skin"<br>"cheapest carrier oil" | ⚠️ Consumer focus, not B2B |
| **Transactional** | **<1%** | "hbno essential oils" (branded only) | ✅ Ready to buy |
| **Navigational** | **5.92%** | "hbno" brand searches | ✅ Ready to buy |

**What This Means:**
- 9 out of 10 visitors arrive seeking "how-to" information, not products
- You're attracting B2C wellness enthusiasts researching home remedies
- Almost no B2B bulk buyers finding the site through organic search
- The traffic is high volume but low quality for e-commerce

### Missing B2B Commercial Keywords

**High-Value Keywords NOT Ranking For:**
- "bulk essential oil suppliers"
- "wholesale castor oil"
- "essential oils for cosmetic formulation"
- "private label essential oil supplier"
- "55 gallon drum jojoba oil price"
- "essential oil certificate of analysis"
- "organic carrier oils wholesale"

**Impact:** Your hbnobulk.com subdomain exists, but organic traffic isn't finding it. The B2B buyer journey is completely untapped.

## CTR Performance Analysis

### The 78% CTR Decline

| Period | Average CTR | Context |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Previous Agency** | 5.47% | Focused, high-intent traffic |
| **Current (Allen/In-house)** | 1.20% | ❌ Broad-net, low-intent traffic |
| **Decline** | **-78%** | Quality vs. quantity trade-off |

**Root Cause:** The broad keyword strategy targeting informational queries has massively increased impressions (+627%) and clicks (+222%), but at the cost of relevance. When your page ranks for "how to use tea tree oil on dogs," but your title/description is about selling tea tree oil in bulk, users don't click—and even if they do, they don't buy.

**Industry Context:**
- B2B CTR typically ranges 2-4% for non-branded terms
- 5.47% (previous agency) was exceptionally high, likely hyper-focused on branded/bottom-funnel keywords
- 1.20% (current) indicates severe intent mismatch between queries and site offering

## Mobile Experience Analysis

### Bounce Rate Deep Dive

| Device | Bounce Rate | Industry Average | Status |
|--------|-------------|------------------|---------|
| **Mobile** | **85%** | 40-60% | ❌ Critical issue |
| **Desktop** | Not specified | 40-60% | Need data |
| **Overall Site** | Not specified | 40-60% | Likely elevated |

**85% mobile bounce rate** means:
- 85 out of 100 mobile visitors leave immediately
- Mobile UX is likely poor (slow load, hard to navigate, small buttons)
- With mobile-first indexing, this hurts SEO rankings
- Major lost revenue opportunity (mobile = 60%+ of e-commerce traffic)

**Hypothesis:** Product pages aren't optimized for mobile shopping behavior. Touch targets too small, images slow to load, add-to-cart button not prominent.

---

## Top Product Performance

### Revenue Leaders (Top 3)

| Product | Monthly Revenue | % of Total | Add-to-Cart Potential |
|---------|----------------|------------|----------------------|
| **Rosemary Oil** | $11,200 | 9.3% | High - optimize first |
| **Peppermint Oil** | $10,800 | 9.0% | High - optimize first |
| **Lavender Oil** | $10,000 | 8.3% | High - optimize first |
| **Combined Top 3** | **$32,000** | **26.6%** | Small improvements = big gains |

**Opportunity:** Optimizing just these 3 products could improve overall revenue by 10-15% if add-to-cart rates increase.

---

## Site Performance Metrics

### Core Web Vitals (Post-Theme Change)

| Metric | Status | Impact |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **Theme Change Impact** | +22.8% clicks, +14.9% impressions | ✅ Positive |
| **Average Position** | Improved 3.4% | ✅ Positive |
| **CTR Post-Theme** | 0.82% (up from 0.77%) | ⚠️ Still low overall |

**Note:** The recent theme change (July 19, 2025) improved technical SEO, likely enhancing Core Web Vitals (LCP, INP, CLS) and mobile-friendliness. This is working well—we need to build on this foundation.

## Competitive Context

### Industry Benchmarks

| Metric | HBNO Current | Industry Standard | Gap |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|-----|
| **Add-to-Cart Rate** | 2.03% | 8-10% | -6 to -8 points |
| **Site Conversion** | 0.72% | 2-3% | -1.3 to -2.3 points |
| **Organic CTR (B2B)** | 1.20% | 2-4% | -0.8 to -2.8 points |
| **Checkout Conversion** | 53.3% | 40-50% | ✅ +3 to +13 points |
| **Mobile Bounce** | 85% | 40-60% | +25 to +45 points |

**Key Insight:** HBNO excels at converting engaged visitors (checkout), but fails at two earlier stages:
1. **Attracting the right visitors** (traffic quality/SEO)
2. **Engaging visitors with products** (add-to-cart optimization)

## Summary: The Real Problem

### It's NOT Just a Product Page Problem

The data reveals a **dual root cause:**

**Root Cause #1: Wrong Audience (Traffic Quality)**
- 90%+ informational traffic with zero purchase intent
- CTR dropped 78% due to intent mismatch
- B2C wellness seekers, not B2B bulk buyers
- Missing all high-value commercial keywords

**Root Cause #2: Product Page Optimization Needs**
- 85% mobile bounce rate (UX issues)
- Lack of trust signals (reviews, guarantees)
- Weak add-to-cart CTAs and button design
- 2.03% add-to-cart (should be 8-10%)

**Why Both Matter:**
- Even perfect product pages won't convert "how-to" traffic
- Even perfect traffic will bounce if product pages don't inspire trust
- **Both must be fixed simultaneously for maximum impact**

---

## Next Steps

To address these baseline issues, we need:
1. **Traffic Quality Optimization** - Shift from informational → commercial keywords
2. **Product Page Optimization** - Improve trust signals, mobile UX, CTAs
3. **Continuous Testing** - A/B test improvements, track KPIs weekly
4. **B2B Content Strategy** - Build authority for bulk/wholesale keywords

→ See [Opportunity Assessment](../03-opportunity-assessment/revenue-opportunity.md) for the financial impact of fixing these issues.
