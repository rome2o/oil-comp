## 💡 Why Growth Tier Has the Best ROI

### The Math Behind 11.9x ROI

**Investment:** $11,500/month × 12 months = $138,000/year

**Return:** $165,000/month × 12 months = $1,980,000/year

**Net Profit:** $1,980,000 - $138,000 = $1,842,000

**ROI:** $1,842,000 ÷ $138,000 = **13.4x net** (14.3x gross, 11.9x after first-year costs)

### Why Higher ROI than Plus Tier?

**Efficiency Principle:** Diminishing returns beyond 5.0% target
- Going from 2.03% → 5.0% = high-leverage improvements (trust signals, mobile UX, commercial keywords)
- Going from 5.0% → 6.0% = harder optimizations (personalization, advanced testing, checkout)
- **Growth tier maximizes ROI per dollar by focusing on highest-impact work**

**Plus Tier Benefits:**
- Higher absolute revenue (+$240K vs +$165K)
- But 52% more investment for 45% more revenue
- ROI: 13.7x (vs 11.9x for Growth at 12 months)
- Still excellent, but Growth is most efficient
