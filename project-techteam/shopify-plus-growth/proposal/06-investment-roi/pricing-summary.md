## 💡 Why Growth Tier Has the Best ROI

### The Math Behind 4.56x ROI

**Investment:** $11,500/month × 12 months = $138,000/year

**Net Profit:** $628,500 - $138,000 = $490,500

**ROI:** $628,500 ÷ $138,000 = **4.56x**

### Why Industry-Leading ROI?

**Dual-Track Efficiency:** Simultaneous optimization delivers multiplier effect

- Product pages + traffic quality = compound improvements
- Going from 2.03% → 3.25% = highest-leverage improvements (trust signals, mobile UX, commercial keywords)
- **Growth tier maximizes ROI per dollar by focusing on proven, high-impact optimizations**

**Plus Tier Benefits:**

- Faster timeline and higher absolute revenue
- But 52% more investment for incremental gains
