## 💡 Why Growth Tier Has the Best ROI

### The Math Behind 17.4x ROI

**Investment:** $9,500/month × 12 months = $114,000/year

**Return:** $165,000/month × 12 months = $1,980,000/year

**Net Profit:** $1,980,000 - $114,000 = $1,866,000

**ROI:** $1,866,000 ÷ $114,000 = **16.4x net** (17.4x gross)

### Why Higher ROI than Plus Tier?

**Efficiency Principle:** Diminishing returns beyond 5.0% target
- Going from 2.03% → 5.0% = high-leverage improvements (trust signals, mobile UX, commercial keywords)
- Going from 5.0% → 6.0% = harder optimizations (personalization, advanced testing, checkout)
- **Growth tier maximizes ROI per dollar by focusing on highest-impact work**

**Plus Tier Benefits:**
- Higher absolute revenue (+$240K vs +$165K)
- But 58% more investment for 45% more revenue
- ROI: 16.0x (vs 17.4x for Growth)
- Still excellent, but Growth is most efficient

## 🛡️ Risk Mitigation: Hard Hour Caps

### How We Protect Both Sides

**Every tier has hard hour caps:**
- Starter: 45 hours/month maximum

- Plus: 100 hours/month maximum

**What This Means:**
- ✅ You'll never be overcharged for scope creep
- ✅ We prioritize highest-impact work within cap

**If Hour Cap is Reached:**
- Additional work requires separate approval
- Or deferred to next month
- Or upgrade to higher tier if consistently over

**This protects you from:** Agencies that bill endlessly for minor tasks  
**This protects us from:** Scope creep and unrealistic expectations
