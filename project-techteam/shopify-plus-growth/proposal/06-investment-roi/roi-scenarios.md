## 🎯 What Determines Which Scenario You Hit?

### Conservative Scenario Factors

**You'll likely hit conservative if:**
- Limited internal resources for approvals/implementation
- Slow decision-making on design/content
- Technical limitations or platform constraints
- Competitive market makes SEO gains harder
- Seasonal fluctuations negatively impact results

**Mitigation:**
- Weekly check-ins to unblock decisions
- Pre-approve design patterns to speed execution
- Identify technical constraints early
- Adjust strategy based on competitive landscape

### Expected Scenario Factors (Most Common)

**You'll likely hit expected if:**
- Reasonable collaboration and approval timelines
- HBNO provides product info, brand assets promptly
- No major technical limitations
- Market conditions remain stable
- Execution follows proven playbook

**This is the baseline assumption** - most clients hit 90-110% of target.

### Aggressive Scenario Factors

**You'll likely exceed targets if:**
- Exceptionally fast approval and decision-making
- Strong product-market fit for B2B audience
- Favorable competitive landscape (low B2B SEO competition)
- Seasonal upswing coincides with optimization
- Additional marketing efforts (email, ads) amplify results
- HBNO goes "all-in" on B2B positioning

**Indicators for aggressive scenario:**
- CTR improvements exceed 100% in Month 1
- Commercial traffic shifts faster than projected (30%+ by Month 2)
- Product page optimizations consistently beat +25% targets

## 💡 Risk-Adjusted Expected Value

### Probability-Weighted ROI

**Assigning probabilities to each scenario:**

| Scenario | Probability | ROI | Weighted ROI |
|----------|-------------|-----|--------------|
| Conservative | 20% | 12.1x | 2.4x |
| Expected | 60% | 17.4x | 10.4x |
| Aggressive | 20% | 25.3x | 5.1x |
| **Weighted Average** | 100% | — | **17.9x** |

**Interpretation:** Even accounting for risk of underperformance, expected ROI is 17.9x.

### Downside Protection

**What if results are worse than conservative?**

Even if you only achieve **50% of target:**
- Add-to-cart: 2.03% → 3.0% (+48%)
- Revenue increase: +$60K/month
- Year 1 ROI: 6.3x
- Payback: 56 days

**Even at 50% target achievement, you still get 6.3x ROI** - better than most investments.
