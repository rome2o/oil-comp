# ROI Scenarios: Conservative, Expected, Aggressive

**Program:** Product Page Optimization + Traffic Quality  
**Date:** November 14, 2025  
**Investment:** $11,500/month (Growth Tier - Recommended)

## 📊 Three Financial Scenarios

All scenarios based on same $11,500/month investment | All assume dual-track optimization approach

**Important Note on Timeline:** Traffic quality transformation takes 6-12 months due to:

**90-day results are driven by page optimization; 6-12 month results add traffic quality improvements.**

- Reasonable collaboration and approval timelines
- HBNO provides product info, brand assets promptly
- No major technical limitations
- Market conditions remain stable
- Execution follows proven playbook

**This is the baseline assumption** - most clients hit expected scenario with proper execution.

### Optimistic Scenario Factors

**You'll likely exceed targets if:**

- Exceptionally fast approval and decision-making
- Strong product-market fit for B2B audience
- Favorable competitive landscape (low B2B SEO competition)
- Seasonal upswing coincides with optimization
- Additional marketing efforts (email, ads) amplify results
- HBNO goes "all-in" on B2B positioning

| Optimistic | 20% | 5.58x | 1.12x |
