## 💰 Year 1 Financial Summary

**Total Investment:** $138,000 (12 months × $11,500)  
**Total Revenue Increase:** $1,640,000 (cumulative over 12 months)  
**Net Profit:** $1,502,000  
**Average ROI:** 11.9x  
**Payback Period:** 10 days (Month 1)

**Why Phased Timeline?**

Traffic quality transformation is constrained by:

1. **Toxic Backlink Processing:** 1,621 toxic backlinks require 3-6 months for Google to fully process
2. **Content Ranking Shift:** Informational content rankings take 4-6 months to shift toward commercial keywords
3. **Authority Building:** New transactional content needs 2-4 months to establish ranking authority

Product pages can be optimized quickly (8-12 per month), but traffic quality improvements compound gradually—hence the phased approach showing 3.5% at 90 days, 4.5% at 6 months, and 5.0%+ at 12 months.
