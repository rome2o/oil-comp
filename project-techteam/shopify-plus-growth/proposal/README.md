## 📊 Key Data Points

### Current Performance (Last 30 Days)

- **Monthly Revenue:** $120,000
- **Sessions:** 36,490
- **Orders:** 272
- **Site Conversion Rate:** 0.72% (below industry 2-3%)
- **⚠️ Add-to-Cart Rate:** 2.03% (industry: 8-10%)
- **✅ Checkout Conversion:** 53.3% (excellent - no optimization needed)
- **Bounce Rate:** 85%
- **Average Order Value:** $459

### The Core Issue

Your checkout is performing excellently (53.3% conversion). The problem is that only **2 out of every 100 visitors** engage enough to add products to their cart. This is a product page engagement problem, not a checkout problem.

### The Opportunity

By improving add-to-cart rate through phased approach:
- 90 days: 2.03% → 3.5% (+$77K/month)
- 6 months: 3.5% → 4.5% (+$135K/month)
- 12 months: 4.5% → 5.0% (+$165K/month)
- **+$1.98M annual revenue at 12 months**
- **11.9x ROI** on $11,500/month investment
- **10-day payback period**
