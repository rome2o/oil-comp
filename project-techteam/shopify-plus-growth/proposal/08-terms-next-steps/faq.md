# Frequently Asked Questions

**Common Questions About the Shopify Plus Growth Program**

---

## 🎯 Program & Approach

### Q: Why the dual-track approach (Traffic Quality + Product Pages)?

**A:** Because your data shows two distinct problems:

1. **Traffic Quality:** 50% of your visitors are non-commercial (essential oil DIY, aromatherapy hobbyists) with low purchase intent. Traffic is "leaky" before it even reaches product pages.

2. **Product Page Conversion:** Even commercial visitors have a 2.03% add-to-cart rate (industry average is 4-5%). Your product pages are underperforming.

**Single-track approaches fail:**
- SEO-only: Brings more traffic, but still converts at 2.03% (minimal revenue impact)
- CRO-only: Optimizes for wrong audience (DIY hobbyists still won't buy bulk)

**Dual-track wins:** Better traffic (B2B/commercial) + better conversion (5.0% add-to-cart) = exponential lift.

### Q: How is this different from hiring an SEO agency or CRO consultant?

**A:**

**Traditional SEO Agency:**
- Focus: Rankings and traffic volume
- Problem: Brings any traffic (including non-buyers)
- Result: Vanity metrics, low revenue impact

**Traditional CRO Consultant:**
- Focus: Optimizing existing traffic
- Problem: Polishing a turd (wrong audience)
- Result: Marginal gains, can't overcome traffic quality issues

**Devkind Growth Program:**
- Focus: Commercial traffic + conversion optimization
- Approach: Revenue-first, not traffic-first
- Result: $165K/month revenue lift (not just more visits)

**We don't just drive traffic or tweak buttons—we re-architect your customer acquisition funnel.**

---

### Q: What if we just want SEO or just want CRO?

**A:** You can, but we strongly advise against it based on your data.

**SEO-Only Scenario:**
- More traffic at same 2.03% conversion rate
- To hit $165K/month, you'd need 3x traffic volume
- Cost: More expensive, takes 6+ months
- Risk: Audience mismatch persists

**CRO-Only Scenario:**
- Optimize for DIY audience (wrong fit)
- Conversion may improve to 3.0% (vs our 5.0%)
- Revenue lift: ~$50K/month (vs our $165K)
- Problem: Still fighting traffic quality issue

**Dual-Track (Recommended):**
- Laser-focused commercial traffic (B2B buyers)
- Optimized conversion for that audience
- Faster results (90 days vs 6+ months)
- Higher ROI (17.4x vs 5-8x typical)

**Bottom line:** Dual-track is the only approach that addresses both root causes.

## 💰 Pricing & Investment

### Q: Why is Growth Tier ($9,500/mo) the "sweet spot"?

**A:**

**Starter Tier ($6,500/mo):**
- 40 hours/month
- Can only optimize 2-3 product pages in 90 days
- Limited keyword targeting (5-7 keywords)
- ROI: 10.9x (good, not great)
- Best for: Testing the waters, low-risk businesses

**Growth Tier ($9,500/mo) ← RECOMMENDED:**
- 65 hours/month
- Full 90-day roadmap execution
- 5 product pages optimized
- 10-12 commercial keywords targeted

---

### Q: Is there a setup fee or onboarding cost?

**A:** No.

- No setup fee
- No hidden costs
- No surprise charges
- Flat monthly fee ($9,500 for Growth Tier)

**What's included:**
- All strategy, design, and implementation work

**Read more:** [Out of Scope](../04-solution-services/out-of-scope.md)

---

### Q: What happens if we exceed the hour cap?

**A:** You're protected. We stop work and discuss options.

**How Hour Caps Work:**
- Growth Tier = 65 hours/month hard cap
- We track time weekly and report transparently
- If approaching cap (e.g., 55 hours used), we notify you
- At 65 hours, we pause work until next month

**Options if hitting cap:**
- Prioritize remaining work for next month (most common)
- Purchase additional hours ($150/hr overage rate)
- Upgrade to Plus Tier ($15,000/mo for 100 hours)

**Why this protects you:**
- No surprise bills
- Predictable costs
- Forces us to be efficient
- Ensures we don't gold-plate deliverables

**In practice:** Most clients never hit the cap because we scope work to fit within hours.

**Read more:** [Team Protection](../07-risk-management/team-protection.md)

---

### Q: Can we start with Starter Tier and upgrade later?

**A:** Yes, but we recommend starting with Growth Tier. Here's why:

**If You Start with Starter ($6,500/mo):**
- Month 1-2: Limited progress (only 2-3 product pages)
- Month 3: Realize you need more to hit targets
- Month 4-5: Upgrade to Growth, play catch-up
- **Result:** 5-month timeline instead of 3 months, delayed ROI

**If You Start with Growth ($9,500/mo):**
- Month 1-3: Full execution, 5 product pages optimized
- Month 4+: Maintaining gains, scaling to new products
- **Result:** Faster payback, higher cumulative revenue

**Upgrade Path:**
- Starter → Growth: Simple, just increases monthly hours/budget
- Growth → Plus: For rapid expansion (10+ products/month)

**Our advice:** If budget allows, start with Growth to maximize 90-day results.

---

### Q: How much time do we need to invest?

**A:** Minimal—about 3-4 hours/week on average.

**Your Time Breakdown:**

**Week 1 (Kickoff):**
- 60-min kickoff call
- 2 hours providing product info/assets
- **Total: ~3 hours**

**Weeks 2-4 (Month 1):**
- 30-min weekly check-in calls

**Monthly:**
- 30-60 min performance review call
- Review monthly report (~30 min)

**Total Over 90 Days:** ~20-25 hours (or ~2 hours/week average)

**What makes this lightweight:**
- We do the heavy lifting (strategy, design, implementation)
- You approve and provide feedback (not doing the work)
- Async communication (email) for most updates

---

### Q: Do we need a dedicated project manager on our side?

**A:** Not required, but helpful. Here's what you need:

**Minimum (Required):**
- **1 Primary Contact:** Decision-maker or marketing lead
  - Responsibilities: Approvals, feedback, weekly check-ins
  - Time: 2-3 hours/week
  - Example: Owner, Marketing Director

**Ideal Setup:**
- **Primary Contact + Coordinator:**
  - Coordinator handles logistics (access, assets, scheduling)
  - Primary Contact handles strategy and approvals
  - Time: 2-3 hours/week (split between 2 people)

**Not Needed:**
- Full-time project manager
- Technical resource (we handle implementation)
- Designer (we design everything)

**Our role:** We act as your external project manager, driving timeline and deliverables.

## 🎯 Results & Risk

### Q: What if we don't hit the $165K/month revenue target?

**A:** We have multiple levers to pull and built-in accountability.

**If Month 1 underperforms:**
- Review: What's working, what's not?
- Adjust: Pivot strategy (e.g., different keywords, different product focus)
- Iterate: A/B test alternate approaches
- **Goal:** Course-correct before Month 2

**If Month 2 underperforms:**
- Escalate: Senior strategist reviews account
- Deep dive: Is it traffic quality? Product page? Other factors?
- Pivot: Major strategy shift if needed (e.g., B2B positioning too narrow)
- **Goal:** Ensure Month 3 recovers trajectory

**Built-in Protections:**
- **Hour cap:** You're never overpaying for underperformance
- **Monthly cancellation:** Cancel after Month 1 or 2 if not seeing progress
- **No long-term lock-in:** 90-day program, not 12-month contract

**Realistic expectations:**
- Conservative scenario (+$99K/month) has 85% confidence
- Expected scenario (+$165K/month) has 65% confidence
- We're transparent about risks, not overpromising

### Q: What are the biggest risks to success?

**A:** Based on 50+ similar programs, here are the failure modes:

**Risk 1: Slow Approvals (30% of delays)**
- Problem: Designs sit in "review" for 2+ weeks
- Impact: Delays timeline, compresses testing cycles
- Mitigation: Designate backup approver, 48hr SLA

**Risk 2: Access/Technical Issues (20% of delays)**
- Problem: Can't get Shopify admin or GA access
- Impact: Can't implement changes, stalls progress
- Mitigation: Prioritize access provisioning in Week 0

**Risk 3: Scope Creep (15% of projects)**
- Problem: Client requests "just one more thing" repeatedly
- Impact: Exceeds hour cap, dilutes focus
- Mitigation: Strict change control process, hour tracking

**Risk 4: External Factors (10% of projects)**
- Problem: Google algorithm update, Shopify platform changes
- Impact: Unexpected shifts in performance
- Mitigation: Agile roadmap, can pivot quickly

**Risk 5: Audience Mismatch (5% of projects)**
- Problem: B2B positioning doesn't resonate
- Impact: Traffic quality doesn't improve
- Mitigation: Early testing in Month 1, pivot if needed

**How we mitigate:**
- Weekly check-ins to catch issues early
- Transparent reporting (no hiding bad news)
- Agile approach (adjust course mid-program)

**Read more:** [Risk Management](../07-risk-management/team-protection.md)

---

### Q: Can we cancel if it's not working?

**A:** Yes. Here's how cancellation works:

**Cancellation Policy:**
- **Notice:** 15 days written notice required
- **Billing:** Prorated to work completed in final month
- **No penalties:** No cancellation fees or penalties
- **Work stops:** We cease work at end of notice period

**When you can cancel:**
- After Month 1 (if results underwhelming)
- After Month 2 (if not on track for targets)
- Anytime (with 15-day notice)

**What happens to your work:**
- You keep all deliverables created to date
- You own all designs, copy, code (IP transfers)
- A/B tests remain active (or you can pause)
- We provide transition documentation

**Realistic scenarios:**
- **Month 1 cancel:** Rare (<5%), usually due to internal factors (budget cut, pivot)
- **Month 2 cancel:** Uncommon (~10%), usually performance-related
- **Month 3+ continue:** Most common (75%+), results justify investment

**Our goal:** Make cancellation unnecessary by delivering results early and often.

---

### Q: What happens after the 90-day program ends?

**A:** You have 3 options:

**Option 1: Continue Service (Most Common - 70%)**
- Why: Maintain gains, scale to more products
- Cost: Same monthly rate ($9,500/mo Growth Tier)
- Focus: Expand to 10+ products, advanced optimizations
- **Best for:** Businesses seeing strong ROI, want to keep momentum

**Option 2: Pause Service, Retain Gains**
- Why: Budget constraints, seasonal business, DIY maintenance
- Cost: $0 (you own all work)
- Outcome: Results plateau (no new optimizations)
- **Best for:** Cash-constrained businesses, testing period ended

**Option 3: Upgrade to Plus Tier ($15,000/mo)**
- Why: Exceptional results, ready for rapid expansion
- Hours: 100/month (vs 65)
- Focus: Scale to full catalog (20+ products), new markets
- **Best for:** High-growth businesses, expanding product lines

**What you get to keep (regardless of option):**
- All optimized product pages (5 pages)
- B2B landing page
- Commercial keyword rankings (decay slowly over time)
- A/B testing infrastructure
- All analytics tracking setups

**Typical path:**
- 90% continue for at least 3 more months (total 6 months)
- 50% continue for 12+ months (ongoing optimization)

### Q: Do we need to install new apps or tools?

**A:** Minimal. Most work uses existing Shopify features.

**Likely Installations:**

**A/B Testing (Required):**
- Tool: Google Optimize (free) or VWO (if budget allows)
- Why: Test product page variations

- Most older themes (1.0 architecture)
- Custom themes built by developers

**Potential issues (rare):**
- Heavily customized themes with locked sections
- Themes with broken code (we'll fix if needed)
- Extremely old themes (pre-2018) - may recommend upgrade

**If theme incompatible:**
- Option 1: Work around limitations (most common)
- Option 2: Upgrade theme (additional cost, discussed upfront)
- Option 3: Build custom sections (within hour cap)

**Theme upgrade cost (if needed):**
- Simple migration: 10-15 hours ($1,500-2,250)
- Complex migration: 20-30 hours ($3,000-4,500)
- **Note:** Rare, only if theme blocking key optimizations

---

### Q: Do you handle mobile optimization?

**A:** Yes, mobile is a priority (60%+ of your traffic is mobile).

**Our mobile approach:**
- **Mobile-first design:** Optimize for mobile before desktop
- **Touch targets:** Buttons sized for thumbs (not mouse clicks)
- **Fast loading:** Page speed optimizations (images, code)
- **Simplified forms:** Fewer fields, easier checkout

**Mobile-specific tests:**
- Product page layouts (mobile vs desktop variations)
- Image galleries (swipe vs click)
- Add-to-cart button placement (thumb zone)
- Trust signals (above fold on mobile)

**All designs tested on:**
- iPhone (Safari)
- Android (Chrome)
- iPad (tablet layouts)

**Mobile performance targets:**
- Page load: <3 seconds (currently 4-5 sec)
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): <2.5 sec

### Q: What if we don't like the work or need revisions?

**A:** Unlimited revisions within reason, but let's define "reason."

**Revision Policy:**

**Included (No Extra Cost):**
- Design iterations (2-3 rounds typical)
- Copy adjustments (tone, messaging)
- Bug fixes or issues from our work
- Performance-based pivots (if test underperforms)

**Not Included (Scope Creep):**
- Complete redesigns (new direction)
- New features beyond original scope
- Revisions due to changing stakeholder preferences
- "Gold plating" (perfecting beyond ROI)

**How revisions work:**
1. You provide specific feedback (not "I don't like it")
2. We implement changes within 2-3 business days
3. Review and approve (or another round)
4. Typical: 2 revision rounds, then finalize

**If excessive revisions:**
- We'll flag if approaching hour cap
- Discuss prioritization (focus on ROI, not perfection)
- Option: Purchase additional hours if needed

**Our goal:** Get it right, not get it perfect. Perfectionism kills ROI.

## 🔄 Comparison & Alternatives

### Q: Should we hire a full-time marketer instead?

**A:** Let's compare:

**Full-Time Marketer ($60-80K/year salary):**
- Cost: $5,000-6,700/month (salary only)
- Benefits: +$1,500/month (health, taxes)
- Ramp time: 2-3 months (learning your business)
- Skills: Generalist (good at many things, expert at none)
- Turnover risk: 12-18 month average tenure
- **Total cost:** $6,500-8,200/month + 3-month ramp

**Devkind Growth Program ($9,500/month):**
- Cost: $9,500/month (all-in)
- Team: 5 specialists (SEO, CRO, UX, copy, dev)
- Ramp time: 1 week (we've done this 50+ times)
- Skills: Deep expertise in Shopify growth

**When to use Devkind:**
- Need rapid results (3 months, not 6-9)
- Want specialist expertise (not generalist)
- Can't afford hiring risk ($50K mistake if wrong person)

**Hybrid option:** Hire full-time for ongoing work, use Devkind for strategic projects.

---

### Q: What about doing this ourselves (DIY)?

**A:** You can, but here's the realistic timeline and cost:

**DIY Approach:**

**Learning curve:**
- SEO fundamentals: 40-60 hours (courses, books)
- CRO best practices: 30-40 hours
- Shopify development: 20-30 hours
- A/B testing tools: 10-15 hours
- **Total learning: 100-145 hours**

**Execution:**
- B2B keyword research: 20 hours
- Product page redesigns: 40 hours (5 pages x 8 hours)
- A/B testing setup and management: 30 hours
- Copywriting: 20 hours
- Development/implementation: 40 hours
- **Total execution: 150 hours**

**Total DIY time:** 250-295 hours over 90 days = **28-33 hours/week**

**Realistic outcome:**
- Quality: 60-70% of professional work (learning curve)
- Timeline: 6-9 months (not 90 days)
- Opportunity cost: What else could you do with 300 hours?

**DIY cost:**
- Your time: 300 hours x $100/hr value = $30,000 opportunity cost
- Tools: A/B testing, heatmaps, SEO tools = $200-500/month
- Mistakes: Broken pages, wasted ad spend = $2,000-5,000
- **Total: $35,000-40,000** (vs our $28,500 for 90 days)

**When DIY makes sense:**
- You're a marketer/developer yourself
- You have 30+ hours/week to dedicate
- You enjoy learning and experimenting
- Timeline isn't critical (results in 9-12 months OK)

**When Devkind makes sense:**
- Want results fast (90 days)
- Don't have 30 hours/week to spare
- Want professional-quality work
- Risk-averse (we've done this before)

## 🎯 Final Thoughts

### Q: Why should we choose Devkind over other agencies?

**A:**

**We're different in 3 ways:**

**1. Revenue-First, Not Vanity Metrics**
- Other agencies: "We'll get you 10K more visitors!"
- Us: "We'll get you $165K/month more revenue."
- We don't chase traffic or rankings—we chase dollars.

**2. Dual-Track Expertise**
- Other agencies: SEO-only or CRO-only (single-track)
- Us: Traffic Quality + Conversion Optimization (dual-track)
- We fix the entire funnel, not just one piece.

**3. Transparent Accountability**
- Other agencies: Black box, unclear ROI
- Us: Weekly reporting, hour caps, clear KPIs
- You always know what's happening and why.

**Plus:**
- 50+ Shopify growth programs delivered
- 17.4x average ROI (vs 5-8x industry average)
- Zero long-term contracts (prove it monthly)

**Bottom line:** We're not the cheapest, but we're the best ROI.

### Q: What's the one thing we should know before deciding?

**A:** This only works if you're ready to commit to the process.

**Success requires:**
- **Fast approvals:** 48-hour turnaround on designs (not 2 weeks)
- **Weekly collaboration:** 2-3 hours/week of your time
- **Trust the data:** Let A/B tests run (not "I prefer this version")
- **90-day commitment:** Long enough to see results (Month 1 is just foundation)

**This WON'T work if:**
- You want results in 2 weeks (SEO takes 4-8 weeks)
- You can't provide timely feedback (kills momentum)
- You're not aligned internally (stakeholder conflicts)
- You want to micromanage (we know what works)

**Honest self-assessment:**
- Are you ready to collaborate weekly? (Not just "do it for us")
- Can you make decisions quickly? (Not committee-by-committee approvals)
- Are you willing to trust data over opinions? (A/B tests trump gut feelings)

**If yes to all:** You're an ideal client. Let's do this.  
**If no to any:** Let's discuss how to address before starting.
