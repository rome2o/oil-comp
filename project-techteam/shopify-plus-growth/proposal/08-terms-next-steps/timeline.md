## 🚀 Critical Path Dependencies

### What Could Delay Timeline?

**Common Delays:**

1. **Access Provisioning (Week 0):**

   - **Mitigation:** Prioritize access requests immediately upon signing

2. **Design Approvals (Week 2):**

   - Internal design review process
   - **Mitigation:** Designate backup approver, set 48hr SLA

3. **Payment Processing (Week -1):**
   - Check processing delays

   - **Mitigation:** Use ACH or wire transfer for faster clearance

4. **Product Information (Week 1-2):**
