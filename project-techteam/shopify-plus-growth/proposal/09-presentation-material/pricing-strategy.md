# Pricing Strategy: The Anchor-and-Discount Approach

**Target Client:** HBNO (Josef + Jonida)  
**Psychology:** Wholesaler mindset, needs to "win" a discount  
**Current Spend:** $9-11K/month on Upwork (negative results)  
**Target:** Close Growth Tier at $9,500/month

---

## 🎯 Strategic Objective

**Primary Goal:** Get Josef to commit to Growth Tier ($9,500/month) and feel like he "won"

**Psychological Approach:**
1. Anchor high (Plus Tier at $15,000/month)
2. Recommend mid (Growth Tier at $9,500/month)
3. Show contrast (Starter Tier at $6,500/month)
4. Add "discount" (waive $2,500 audit fee)
5. Compare to current spend ($10K/month on Upwork)
6. Reframe as savings ($500/month less than current)

## 💰 The Pricing Reveal (Slide 11)

### Step 1: Present All Three Tiers

**Show the comparison table:**

|  | **Starter Tier** | **Growth Tier** ⭐ | **Plus Tier** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Monthly Investment** | $6,500 | $9,500 | $15,000 |
| **Timeline to 5%** | 6 months | 90 days | 60 days |

**Narration:**
> "I've structured three tiers based on speed and scope. Let me walk you through each..."

**Purpose:** Establish the range and anchor high.

---

### Step 2: Anchor High (Plus Tier)

**Emphasize Plus Tier value:**
> "Plus Tier is $15,000/month. This is maximum speed—you hit 5% add-to-cart in 60 days instead of 90. You get 6-8 product pages optimized per month, 25-30 commercial keywords, and advanced A/B testing with heatmaps. This is for businesses that need urgent turnarounds."

**Add the audit value:**
> "And with Plus Tier, the $2,500 audit fee is completely waived. So you're getting $17,500 worth of value."

**Purpose:** Make $15,000 feel reasonable and establish $17,500 as "full value."

---

### Step 3: Recommend Mid (Growth Tier)

**Pivot to Growth Tier:**
> "But I don't think you need Plus. What I recommend for your situation is **Growth Tier**."

**Explain why:**
> "Growth Tier is $9,500/month. You get 4-5 product pages optimized per month, 15-20 commercial keywords, weekly calls, and full A/B testing. Timeline is 90 days to hit 5% add-to-cart. This is the balanced approach—fast results without overspending."

**Add the audit mention:**
> "Now, Growth Tier normally includes a $2,500 audit fee, which brings the total to $12,000."

**Purpose:** Position Growth as the "smart choice" and set up the discount.

---

### Step 4: The "Discount" (Waive Audit)

**Deliver the win:**
> "But given your situation—you've been hurt by the Upwork approach, you need results fast, and I want to show you what we can do—**I'm going to waive that $2,500 audit fee.**"

**Emphasize the value:**
> "That audit is already complete. It's part of this proposal you're seeing today. Normally, that's a $2,500 standalone deliverable. But if you commit to Growth Tier, it's on us. So you're getting $12,000 worth of value for $9,500/month."

**Purpose:** Josef "wins" $2,500. This satisfies his wholesaler need to negotiate.

---

### Step 5: Compare to Current Spend

**Deliver the kicker:**
> "Now here's the important part: **You're currently spending $10,000/month on Upwork.** And getting negative results—conversions down 44%."

**Pause for impact.**

> "Growth Tier is $9,500/month. That's **$500 LESS** than you're spending right now. But instead of going backwards, you're going forward."

**Purpose:** Reframe from "expense" to "savings."

---

### Step 6: Show Contrast (Starter Tier)

**Present Starter as the "cheap option":**
> "Now, if budget is tight, there's Starter Tier at $6,500/month. But here's the trade-off: Starter takes 6 months to hit 5% add-to-cart vs 90 days with Growth. That's 3 extra months of losing $165K/month—a $495K cost to save $3K/month. Plus, you want fast movement—Starter is slow by design."

**Purpose:** Make Starter look like false economy. Growth is the smart choice.

---

### Step 7: The Close

**Deliver the recommendation:**
> "So here's what I recommend: **Growth Tier at $9,500/month, with the $2,500 audit waived.** You're getting:
> - $12,000 worth of value for $9,500/month
> - $500/month savings vs your current Upwork spend
> - 90-day timeline to $165K/month additional revenue
> - 17.4x ROI by Month 3
> - Hard hour caps and no long-term lock-in

> This is the fastest path to results without overspending. Does this make sense for where you want to take HBNO?"

**Purpose:** Clear recommendation + ask for commitment.

## 🧠 Psychological Breakdown

### Why This Works on Josef (Wholesaler Mindset)

**1. Anchor Effect:**
- Seeing $15,000 first makes $9,500 feel like a deal
- $17,500 "full value" makes $9,500 feel like 44% off

**2. The "Win":**
- Josef gets a $2,500 discount without even asking
- Satisfies his need to negotiate/win
- He feels smart for getting value

**3. Savings Frame:**
- Not "$9,500/month cost"
- It's "$500/month savings vs Upwork"
- Reframes from expense to investment

**4. Contrast Effect:**
- Starter looks cheap but slow
- Plus looks expensive and unnecessary
- Growth looks like the Goldilocks option

**5. Risk Mitigation:**
- "No long-term lock-in" removes commitment fear
- "Hard hour caps" removes budget overrun fear
- "17.4x ROI" removes investment risk fear

## 🎭 Delivery Tips

### Tone and Pacing

**When presenting Plus Tier:**
- Speak confidently, as if it's a real option
- Don't dismiss it—legitimize it first
- "This is for urgent turnarounds..."

**When pivoting to Growth:**
- Use softer tone: "But I don't think you need Plus..."
- Position as consultant: "What I recommend is..."
- Be definitive: "Growth Tier is the balanced approach."

**When delivering the discount:**
- Pause before revealing
- Build slight anticipation: "Now, Growth Tier normally includes..."
- Deliver as a gift: "But given your situation, I'm going to waive that $2,500 audit fee."
- Smile (even on video call—they can hear it)

**When comparing to Upwork spend:**
- Use contrast tone—emphasize the absurdity
- "You're currently spending $10K/month... for NEGATIVE results."
- Pause. Let it sink in.
- "This is $500 LESS... for POSITIVE results."

## 🛡️ Objection Handling (Pricing-Specific)

### Objection: "Can you do $8,000/month?"

**Response:**
> "I've already waived the $2,500 audit—which we completed as part of this proposal. That brings your effective cost to $9,500, which is $500 less than you're spending now on Upwork. 
>
> At $8K, we'd have to drop to Starter tier. That means:
> - 6 months to results instead of 90 days
> - 2-3 product pages/month instead of 4-5
> - 5-10 keywords instead of 15-20
>
> That's 3 extra months of losing $165K/month—a **$495K cost** to save $1,500/month. Growth tier pays for itself in 20 days.
>
> I can't go lower without compromising results. And you've already tried cheap—that's what got you into this situation."

**Key Message:** Cheap = slow = expensive in lost opportunity.

---

### Objection: "The audit should be free regardless"

**Response:**
> "I hear you. The audit is normally a standalone $2,500 deliverable that we sell to businesses who want diagnosis without commitment. 
>
> I'm waiving it for Growth or Plus tier because I want you to succeed, and I've already invested the time to complete it for this proposal.
>
> With Starter tier, the audit fee applies because the monthly investment is lower and the timeline is longer—we need to cover the upfront analysis cost.
>
> But honestly, the audit fee isn't the decision point here. The decision is: Do you want to keep losing $165K/month, or start adding it? The audit is a rounding error compared to that opportunity."

**Key Message:** Don't get stuck negotiating $2,500 when $165K/month is at stake.

---

### Objection: "What if we start with Starter and upgrade later?"

**Response:**
> "You absolutely can do that. But here's the math:
>
> **Starter Tier:**
> - Month 1-6: Slow progress to 5% add-to-cart
> - Lost opportunity during delay: $495K (3 extra months × $165K)
> - Savings vs Growth: $3K/month × 6 months = $18K
> - **Net cost:** $477K loss
>
> **Growth Tier:**
> - Month 1-3: Hit 5% add-to-cart by Month 3
> - No delayed opportunity
> - Extra cost vs Starter: $18K
> - **Net gain:** Start earning $165K/month 3 months earlier
>
> Plus, Josef, you told me you want fast movement. Starter is slow by design. If speed matters, Growth is the only choice."

**Key Message:** Starter is false economy—loses more in opportunity than it saves in fees.

---

### Objection: "We need to think about it"

**Response:**
> "Absolutely. This is a big decision, and I want you to feel confident.
>
> Let me ask: What specifically do you need to think about? Is it:
> - The investment amount?
> - The timeline?
> - Trust after the Upwork experience?
> - Something else?
>
> If I can address that concern right now, I'd love to. If you need time to discuss internally, I totally understand. How about we schedule a follow-up call in 2-3 days to address any questions?
>
> Just keep in mind: Every month we wait costs $165K in opportunity. I don't say that to pressure you—I say it because it's your money on the table."

**Key Message:** Isolate the objection, address it, create urgency without being pushy.

## 📈 Expected Outcomes

### Best Case: Immediate Commitment

**Signs:**
- Josef asks: "When can we start?"
- Jonida says: "This makes sense, let's do it."
- They discuss logistics (access, timeline) not pricing

**Your response:**
> "Fantastic. I'll send the service agreement today. Standard terms, same as what's in the proposal. Legal review if needed, then sign and submit payment. We can launch in 4 weeks."

---

### Good Case: Positive but Need Time

**Signs:**
- Josef says: "I like this, but I need to discuss with my team."
- Jonida says: "This looks good, but Josef needs to review."
- They're asking clarifying questions, not objecting

**Your response:**
> "Totally understand. Here's what I recommend:
> 1. Review the full proposal package with your team
> 2. Let's schedule a follow-up call in 2-3 days
> 3. Target: Decision by [date], launch by [date]
>
> In the meantime, email or call me with any questions."

---

### Neutral Case: Price Resistance

**Signs:**
- Josef says: "This is more than I expected."
- They're comparing to Upwork's $10K (not the results)
- Hesitation about ROI claims

**Your response:**
> "I hear you. Let me break down the math:
>
> **Upwork (8 months):**
> - Spent: $80,000
> - Got: -44% conversions, 1,621 toxic backlinks
> - Lost opportunity: $1.3M
> - **Total loss: $1.38M**
>
> **Growth Tier (3 months):**
> - Invest: $28,500
> - Get: +146% add-to-cart, $275K revenue increase
> - **Net profit: $246,500**
>
> This isn't more expensive—it's less expensive with actual results. The question isn't cost, it's value. And you're protected with hard caps and no lock-in."

---

### Worst Case: Not Ready / Wrong Fit

**Signs:**
- Josef says: "We can't afford this right now."
- They're focused on price, not value
- No urgency despite $165K/month opportunity

**Your response:**
> "I understand budget constraints. Let me ask: If you could afford this, is this the approach you'd want to take?
>
> [If yes:] Great. Let's talk about a phased approach or delayed start. Maybe we start in Q1 2026 instead of now?
>
> [If no:] That's fair. This might not be the right fit for where you are right now. If circumstances change, I'm here. In the meantime, I'd strongly recommend addressing those 1,621 toxic backlinks before Google penalizes you."

**Key Message:** Qualify out gracefully if they're not a fit. Don't chase bad deals.
