# Negotiation Playbook: Closing Growth Tier

**Client:** HBNO (Josef + Jonida)  
**Target:** Close Growth Tier at $9,500/month  
**Strategy:** Anchor-and-discount with objection handling

---

## 🎯 Pre-Negotiation Framework

### Know Your Numbers

**Your Bottom Line:**
- **Minimum acceptable:** Starter Tier ($6,500/month)
- **Target:** Growth Tier ($9,500/month)
- **Stretch:** Plus Tier ($15,000/month)

**Their Context:**
- Current spend: $10,000/month on Upwork
- Current results: -44% conversions, +99% wrong traffic
- Lost opportunity: $165,000/month
- Pain level: HIGH (Josef wants fast movement)

**Your Leverage:**
- Data-driven diagnosis (you've done the work)
- Clear ROI (17.4x by Month 3)
- Protection framework (hard caps, no lock-in)
- Audit already complete ($2,500 value)
- Speed (4-week launch vs 6+ months DIY)

---

## 🛡️ Common Objections & Responses

### Objection #1: "Can you do $8,000/month?"

**Type:** Price negotiation (wholesaler psychology)

**Response Framework:**

**Step 1: Acknowledge**
> "I appreciate you asking. Let me break down why $9,500 is already the best value..."

**Step 2: Remind of discount**
> "I've already waived the $2,500 audit—which we completed as part of this proposal. That brings your effective cost to $9,500."

**Step 3: Show current spend**
> "You're currently spending $10,000/month on Upwork. This is $500 LESS per month than you're spending now."

**Step 4: Explain tier downgrade**
> "At $8K, we'd have to drop to Starter tier. That means:
> - 6 months to results instead of 90 days (Josef, you want fast movement)
> - 2-3 product pages/month instead of 4-5
> - 5-10 keywords instead of 15-20
> - Bi-weekly calls instead of weekly"

**Step 5: Calculate opportunity cost**
> "Starter takes 3 extra months to hit 5% add-to-cart. That's 3 months of losing $165K/month—a **$495,000 cost** to save $1,500/month. Growth tier pays for itself in 20 days."

**Step 6: Position as expert**
> "I can't go lower without compromising results. And you've already tried cheap—that's what got you into this situation with Upwork."

**Close:**
> "Growth at $9,500 is the smart investment. It's $500 less than you're spending now, delivers in 90 days, and returns 17.4x. Can we move forward with Growth?"

---

### Objection #2: "What if we start with Starter and upgrade later?"

**Type:** Risk mitigation (testing the waters)

**Response Framework:**

**Step 1: Validate the logic**
> "I understand wanting to start small. Let me show you the math on that..."

**Step 2: Compare timelines**
> "**Starter Tier:**
> - Months 1-6: Slow progress toward 5% add-to-cart
> - Month 6: Finally hit target
> - Timeline: 6 months
>
> **Growth Tier:**
> - Months 1-3: Hit 5% add-to-cart by Month 3
> - Timeline: 90 days"

**Step 3: Calculate opportunity cost**
> "That's 3 extra months at current 2.03% performance. You're losing $165K/month during that delay. The 'savings' of $3K/month costs you $495K in delayed results."

**Step 4: Show upgrade friction**
> "Plus, upgrading mid-stream means:
> - Restarting momentum
> - Extending timeline by 4-6 weeks (re-onboarding)
> - Losing continuity in A/B testing
> It's more expensive to start small and upgrade than to start right."

**Step 5: Address Josef's urgency**
> "Josef, you told me you want fast movement. Starter is slow by design. If speed matters—and with $165K/month on the table, it should—Growth is the only choice."

**Close:**
> "Let's commit to Growth for 90 days. If we're not hitting milestones by Month 2, you can downgrade or cancel. Month-to-month commitment means you're protected. But starting with Starter guarantees a 6-month timeline. Why wait?"

---

### Objection #3: "The audit should be free regardless"

**Type:** Value negotiation (audit fee resistance)

**Response Framework:**

**Step 1: Explain standalone value**
> "The audit is normally a $2,500 standalone deliverable. We sell this to businesses who want diagnosis without implementation. It's a full B2B keyword analysis, backlink audit, product page assessment, and strategic roadmap."

**Step 2: Show why you're waiving it**
> "I'm waiving it for Growth or Plus tier because:
> 1. I've already invested the time for this proposal
> 2. I want you to succeed after the Upwork disaster
> 3. The monthly investment at those tiers justifies absorbing the upfront cost"

**Step 3: Explain Starter tier logic**
> "With Starter, the audit fee applies because:
> - Monthly investment is lower ($6,500 vs $9,500)
> - Timeline is longer (6 months vs 90 days)
> - We need to recover the upfront analysis cost over time"

**Step 4: Reframe the decision**
> "But honestly Josef, the audit fee isn't the decision point here. You're losing $165K/month. The audit is a $2,500 line item. That's 0.4 days of lost opportunity. 
>
> The real question is: Do you want to keep losing $165K/month with Upwork, or start adding it with Growth tier?"

**Close:**
> "If the audit fee is the only blocker, let's talk. But I don't want $2,500 to stand in the way of $165K/month. What's the real concern?"

---

### Objection #4: "We need to think about it"

**Type:** Delay tactic (uncertainty or internal politics)

**Response Framework:**

**Step 1: Acknowledge legitimately**
> "Absolutely. This is a big decision, and I want you to feel confident."

**Step 2: Isolate the concern**
> "Let me ask: What specifically do you need to think about? Is it:
> - The investment amount?
> - The timeline?
> - Trust after the Upwork experience?
> - Internal approval process?
> - Something else?"

**Step 3: Address the specific concern**

**If it's budget:**
> "You're spending $10K/month now on Upwork. This is $500 less. We can discuss payment terms if cash flow is tight—split into two payments, net-30, etc."

**If it's trust:**
> "I get it—you were burned. Here's how you're protected:
> - Month-to-month commitment (cancel anytime with 30 days notice)
> - Hard hour caps (20 hours/week max, no overages)
> - Transparent weekly reporting (you see exactly what we're doing)
> - A/B testing validation (only keep changes that work)
> If we're not delivering by Month 2, walk away. Zero long-term risk."

**If it's timeline:**
> "If you're not ready to start now, I understand. When were you thinking? Q1 2026? I can lock in this pricing if we schedule a start date today."

**If it's internal approval:**
> "Got it. What's your approval process? Who else needs to sign off? How can I help? Happy to join a call with your CFO/board/team to present the numbers."

**Step 4: Create urgency (without pressure)**
> "Here's what I want you to consider: Every month we wait costs $165K in opportunity. I don't say that to pressure you—I say it because it's your money on the table. 
>
> Upwork spent 8 months making things worse. That's $1.3M lost. How many more months can you afford to wait?"

**Step 5: Propose next steps**
> "How about this: Take 2-3 days to discuss internally. I'll send you the full proposal package, including financial projections and case studies. Let's schedule a follow-up call for [specific date/time] to address any questions. Sound fair?"

**Close:**
> "I'm here to help, not pressure. But I don't want you leaving money on the table. Let's talk [follow-up date] and make a decision together."

---

### Objection #5: "Why not just fix the Upwork issues ourselves?"

**Type:** DIY comparison (questioning need for agency)

**Response Framework:**

**Step 1: Validate the attempt**
> "You could try. And if you have the right expertise in-house, that might work."

**Step 2: Show the complexity**
> "But here's what you're up against:
>
> **Traffic Quality Issues:**
> - 1,621 toxic backlinks need to be audited, categorized, and disavowed
> - Google Search Console disavowal process is technical (wrong file format = wasted months)
> - Commercial keyword targeting requires B2B buyer intent analysis
> - CTR optimization needs A/B testing infrastructure
>
> **Product Page Issues:**
> - 85% mobile bounce rate requires UX redesign (not just content edits)
> - Trust signal implementation (COAs, certifications, technical specs) needs design and development
> - Bulk pricing tiers require Shopify app integration or custom code
> - A/B testing requires statistical validation (95% confidence, proper sample size)
>
> **Dual-Track Coordination:**
> - Traffic and pages need to improve in parallel
> - Timing matters—launch optimized pages when better traffic arrives
> - Weekly monitoring and iteration based on data"

**Step 3: Show the cost**
> "To do this in-house, you'd need:
> - Technical SEO specialist (Shopify Plus experience): $80-120K/year
> - UX/UI designer (e-commerce focus): $70-100K/year
> - Shopify developer (Liquid + Apps): $80-110K/year
> - Project manager (coordinate all three): $60-80K/year
>
> That's $290-410K/year in salary. Plus tools, software, training, and management overhead.
>
> Or you could invest $9,500/month ($114K/year) and get all four roles, proven methodology, and results in 90 days."

**Step 4: Show the timeline**
> "Even if you hire those people today, it takes:
> - 4-6 weeks to hire and onboard
> - 2-4 weeks for them to audit and strategize
> - 8-12 weeks to execute
>
> That's 4-6 months minimum. During which you're losing $165K/month. That's $660K-990K in lost opportunity.
>
> We can launch in 4 weeks and deliver results in 90 days. That's 2-4 months faster—saving you $330K-660K in opportunity cost."

**Step 5: Address Upwork comparison**
> "Plus, you already tried the cheaper route with Upwork. $13/person for keyword research, general SEO people, black-hat backlinks. That got you -44% conversions and 1,621 toxic links.
>
> This isn't about effort—it's about expertise. Shopify Plus specialization, B2B e-commerce focus, proven methodology. That's what you're paying for."

**Close:**
> "You can absolutely try DIY. But after 8 months of Upwork failure and $1.3M in lost opportunity, do you want to risk another 6 months? Or would you rather invest $28,500 over 90 days and start adding $165K/month?"

---

### Objection #6: "Can we do a pilot/trial period first?"

**Type:** Risk mitigation (wants to test before committing)

**Response Framework:**

**Step 1: Reframe the 90-day program AS the pilot**
> "The 90-day roadmap IS the pilot. Here's why:"

**Step 2: Explain Month 1 structure**
> "Month 1 delivers immediate, visible results:
> - Week 1: Full audit complete
> - Week 2: Strategy and wireframes ready
> - Week 3: First optimized product page live
> - Week 4: Month 1 report showing early add-to-cart improvement
>
> By Week 3, you'll see tangible changes. By Week 4, you'll see data proving it works."

**Step 3: Show the protection**
> "And you're protected:
> - Month-to-month commitment (cancel anytime with 30-day notice)
> - Hard hour caps (20 hours/week max)
> - If we're not hitting milestones by Month 2, cancel
>
> That's essentially a 60-day trial with an early exit option."

**Step 4: Show why shorter trials don't work**
> "A 30-day 'trial' won't work because:
> - Week 1-2 are audit and strategy (no visible product changes)
> - Week 3 is implementation (changes go live)
> - Week 4 is measurement (need 7-10 days of data)
>
> You'd be evaluating before there's anything to evaluate. That's setting us both up for failure."

**Step 5: Compare risk vs opportunity**
> "Let's look at the actual risk:
>
> **Worst case scenario:**
> - You invest $9,500 in Month 1
> - We don't deliver (highly unlikely, but let's assume)
> - You cancel at Month 2
> - Total loss: $9,500
>
> **Opportunity cost of waiting:**
> - Every month delay = $165K lost opportunity
> - Even ONE month delay costs $165K
> - The 'risk' of trying is $9,500
> - The risk of NOT trying is $165K/month
>
> Which risk is bigger?"

**Close:**
> "Commit to 90 days. Month 1 is your trial—if we're not delivering visible results by Week 4, let's have a conversation. But I'm confident you'll see enough progress to continue. Fair?"

---

### Objection #7: "Your projections seem too optimistic"

**Type:** Skepticism (questioning ROI claims)

**Response Framework:**

**Step 1: Acknowledge the skepticism**
> "I appreciate the skepticism—after Upwork promised 'trust me' and delivered disaster, you should be cautious."

**Step 2: Ground in industry benchmarks**
> "Let me show you why these projections are conservative, not optimistic:
>
> **Industry Benchmarks:**
> - E-commerce average add-to-cart: 8-10%
> - B2B e-commerce average: 6-8%
> - Shopify Plus (optimized): 10-12%
> - **HBNO current: 2.03%**
> - **Our target (90 days): 5.0%**
>
> We're not promising you'll hit 10%. We're promising you'll get to 5%—which is HALF the industry average. That's conservative."

**Step 3: Show the math**
> "Let's break down the revenue calculation:
>
> **Current state:**
> - 36,490 sessions/month
> - 2.03% add-to-cart (741 people)
> - 53% checkout completion (393 orders)
> - $305 average order value
> - Revenue: $120,000/month
>
> **Target state (5% add-to-cart):**
> - 36,490 sessions/month (same traffic)
> - 5.0% add-to-cart (1,825 people)
> - 53% checkout completion (968 orders)
> - $305 average order value
> - Revenue: $295,000/month
>
> **Increase: $175,000/month**
>
> The only assumption is improving add-to-cart from 2.03% to 5.0%. Everything else is your current data."

**Step 4: Show pessimistic scenario**
> "Even if we UNDERPERFORM and only hit 3.8% by Month 3:
> - Revenue: $197,000/month
> - Increase: $77,000/month
> - Investment: $9,500/month
> - **ROI: 8.1x**
>
> Even at 50% slower than projected, you're still getting 8x return. That's excellent."

**Step 5: Explain validation method**
> "And we're not guessing—we're testing:
> - A/B testing every change (95% statistical confidence)
> - Weekly add-to-cart tracking (you see the improvement in real-time)
> - If a change doesn't improve conversions, we don't keep it
>
> This is data-driven, not hope-and-prayer."

**Close:**
> "I'm not asking you to trust me blindly like Upwork did. I'm asking you to commit to 90 days of data-validated testing. By Month 2, you'll know if we're on track. If not, cancel. But the projections are based on your data and industry benchmarks—not fantasy."

## 🎯 Negotiation Tactics

### Tactic #1: The Anchor

**When to use:** Early in pricing conversation

**How:**
1. Present Plus Tier ($15,000/month) first
2. Legitimize it ("This is for urgent turnarounds")
3. Show full value ($17,500 with free audit)

**Why it works:**
- Makes $9,500 feel like a bargain
- Establishes high reference point
- Positions Growth as "smart middle choice"

---

### Tactic #2: The Discount (Waive Audit)

**When to use:** When presenting Growth Tier pricing

**How:**
1. Mention audit fee ($2,500) is normally separate
2. Pause slightly
3. "But given your situation, I'm going to waive that $2,500 audit fee"
4. Emphasize: "You're getting $12,000 worth of value for $9,500/month"

**Why it works:**
- Josef "wins" $2,500 without negotiating
- Satisfies wholesaler psychology
- Creates goodwill and reciprocity

---

### Tactic #3: Current Spend Comparison

**When to use:** When they resist price

**How:**
1. Remind: "You're currently spending $10,000/month on Upwork"
2. Contrast: "This is $9,500/month"
3. Reframe: "That's $500 LESS per month"
4. Add: "But instead of going backwards (-44% conversions), you go forward (+146% add-to-cart)"

**Why it works:**
- Reframes from "expense" to "savings"
- Makes them realize they're already spending more for worse results
- Removes price objection

---

### Tactic #4: Opportunity Cost Calculation

**When to use:** When they want to delay or start small

**How:**
1. Show monthly lost opportunity: "$165,000/month"
2. Calculate delay cost: "3 months delay = $495,000 lost"
3. Compare to service cost: "$9,500/month vs $165,000/month opportunity"
4. Ask: "Which number is bigger?"

**Why it works:**
- Makes delay/cheap options look expensive
- Creates urgency without pressure
- Quantifies the cost of inaction

---

### Tactic #5: Risk Reversal

**When to use:** When they're hesitant due to Upwork experience

**How:**
1. Acknowledge fear: "You were burned by Upwork. I get it."
2. Show protection:
   - Month-to-month (no lock-in)
   - Hard hour caps (no overages)
   - Transparent reporting (full visibility)
   - A/B testing (only keep what works)
3. Position cancellation: "If we're not delivering by Month 2, cancel. You're in control."

**Why it works:**
- Removes perceived risk
- Builds trust through transparency
- Makes commitment feel safe

---

### Tactic #6: The Isolation Close

**When to use:** When they say "we need to think about it"

**How:**
1. Ask: "What specifically do you need to think about?"
2. List options: "Is it budget? Timeline? Trust? Something else?"
3. Isolate one concern
4. Address that specific concern
5. Ask: "If we solve [concern], are you ready to move forward?"

**Why it works:**
- Turns vague hesitation into specific objection
- Allows you to address real blocker
- Moves them toward decision

## 🚀 Closing Techniques

### The Assumptive Close

**When to use:** When they're asking logistics questions

**Script:**
> "Great. So when we start in 4 weeks, the first thing we'll need is Shopify admin access and Google Analytics. Who on your team should I coordinate with for that?"

**Why it works:** Assumes sale is done, focuses on implementation.

---

### The Alternative Close

**When to use:** When they seem interested but haven't committed

**Script:**
> "So based on what you've seen, does Growth Tier at $9,500/month make sense? Or would you want to start with Starter at $6,500 and accept the 6-month timeline?"

**Why it works:** Gives them control between two options (both are buying).

---

### The Direct Close

**When to use:** When you've addressed all objections

**Script:**
> "Josef, Jonida—we've covered the problem, the solution, the investment, and the returns. You're losing $165K/month right now. We can fix that in 90 days for $9,500/month. Should we move forward?"

**Why it works:** Clear, direct, no-nonsense. Matches Josef's fast-decision style.

---

### The Urgency Close

**When to use:** When they're delaying

**Script:**
> "I totally understand wanting to think about it. Just keep in mind: we're already in mid-November. If we sign today, we launch in mid-December and hit results by mid-March. If we wait until January, that's mid-February launch and mid-May results. That's 2 extra months—$330K in lost opportunity. When do you want to start seeing results?"

**Why it works:** Quantifies cost of delay without being pushy.

---

## 🎯 Success Indicators

### You're Winning When...

- [ ] They ask "When can we start?" not "Can you go lower?"
- [ ] They discuss logistics (access, timeline) not price
- [ ] Jonida is excited and championing the approach
- [ ] Josef asks clarifying questions (not objections)
- [ ] They say "This makes sense" or "I like this"
- [ ] They're comparing Growth vs Plus (not Growth vs Starter)

### You're Losing When...

- [ ] They keep focusing on price, not value
- [ ] They compare you to Upwork ($10K vs $9.5K, ignoring results)
- [ ] They say "we'll get back to you" with no follow-up date
- [ ] They ask for unreasonable discounts ($6K, $7K)
- [ ] They question every projection and won't accept data
- [ ] Josef isn't engaged (letting Jonida handle alone)

---

## 💡 Final Tips

### Do:
- ✅ Speak confidently about pricing (don't apologize)
- ✅ Use data and benchmarks (not opinions)
- ✅ Acknowledge Upwork pain (builds trust)
- ✅ Show protection framework (removes risk)
- ✅ Create urgency with opportunity cost ($165K/month)
- ✅ Ask for the sale directly

### Don't:
- ❌ Discount below Growth without Starter tier features
