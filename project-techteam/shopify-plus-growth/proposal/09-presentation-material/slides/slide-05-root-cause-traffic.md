## 🎤 Speaking Points

**Opening:**
> "Here's the first root cause: **You're attracting the wrong audience.**"

**Current Traffic Breakdown:**
> "Right now, 90% of your traffic is people searching for informational content:
> - 'How to use tea tree oil on dogs'
> - 'Benefits of helichrysum oil'
> - 'Neem oil side effects'
>
> These are wellness seekers researching home remedies. They're not buying in bulk. They're not B2B customers."

**What You Need:**
> "You need to be attracting searches like:
> - 'Bulk essential oil suppliers'
> - 'Wholesale castor oil for cosmetics'
> - 'Private label essential oil manufacturer'"

**The Problem:**
> "The Upwork strategy drove blog traffic, not buyer traffic. Even perfect product pages can't convert people who came to learn, not purchase."

## 👥 Audience-Specific Positioning

**For Jonida:**
> "This explains why traffic went up but sales didn't—we're getting the wrong people."

**For Josef:**
> "Imagine if 40% of your 36,000 monthly visitors were qualified B2B buyers instead of DIY hobbyists. That's the shift we're targeting."
