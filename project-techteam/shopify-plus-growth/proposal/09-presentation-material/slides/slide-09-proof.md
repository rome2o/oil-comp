## 🎤 Speaking Points

**Opening:**
> "Here's why this works..."

**Industry Benchmarks:**
> "**Industry benchmarks** show that 8-10% add-to-cart rates are standard. You're at 2.03%. This isn't aspirational—it's achievable.
>
> Our target of 5% in 90 days is conservative. We're not promising you'll hit 10% overnight. We're methodically moving you from 2% to 5%, then 5% to 8% over 6 months."

**Methodology Validation:**
> "**Our methodology is proven:**
> - Dual-track (traffic + pages) delivers 2.5x faster results than fixing one thing at a time
> - A/B testing everything means we only keep changes that work
> - Shopify Plus specialization means we know the platform inside-out
> - B2B focus means we understand wholesale buyer behavior"

**Risk Mitigation:**
> "**Risk is minimal:**
> - Hard hour caps protect you from scope creep
> - Month-to-month commitment means you can cancel if we're not delivering
> - Weekly reports keep you informed of progress
> - Success metrics are transparent—you'll know if it's working"
