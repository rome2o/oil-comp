## 🎤 Speaking Points

**Opening:**
> "Let's talk returns—because this is what really matters."

**Conservative Scenario:**
> "**Conservative scenario (Growth Tier):**
>
> Month 1, we hit 2.8% add-to-cart. That's a 38% improvement over your current 2.03%. That adds $33,000 in revenue. You paid $9,500. **ROI: 3.5x**. Payback in 9 days.
>
> Month 2, we hit 3.8%. That's $77,000 additional revenue. **ROI: 8.1x**. Payback in 4 days.
>
> Month 3, we hit 5.0%. That's $165,000 additional revenue. **ROI: 17.4x**. Payback in 1.7 days.
>
> **Total 90-day investment:** $28,500  
> **Total revenue increase:** $275,000  
> **Net profit:** $246,500
>
> That's a 9.7x return in 90 days."

**Extended Value (6 Months):**
> "And that's just the beginning. By Month 6, if we continue optimizing toward 8% add-to-cart (still below the 10% industry standard), you're looking at:
> - Cumulative revenue increase: $990,000
> - Total investment: $57,000
> - **Net profit: $933,000**
>
> That's nearly a million dollars in profit in 6 months."

**Pessimistic Scenario:**
> "**Even in a pessimistic scenario** where we only hit 3.8% by Month 3 (50% slower than expected), you're still getting 8.1x ROI. That's still excellent."

**Optimistic Scenario:**
> "**If we go optimistic with Plus Tier**, you hit 5% by Month 2—60 days instead of 90. Revenue increase happens faster, returns compound sooner."

**The Bottom Line:**
> "No matter which scenario plays out, you're profitable by Week 3. The upside is massive, the downside is minimal."

## 👥 Audience-Specific Positioning

**For Jonida:**
> "These aren't made-up numbers—they're based on your current $120K/month revenue and industry-standard conversion rates."

**For Josef:**
> "17.4x ROI by Month 3. That means every dollar you invest returns $17.40. And payback happens in less than 2 days. This is a no-brainer."
