## 🎤 Speaking Points

**Opening:**
> "Let's talk returns—because this is what really matters."

**Expected Scenario (Ultra-Conservative):**
> "**Expected scenario using our ultra-conservative model:**
>
> Month 1, we achieve 2.08% add-to-cart. That's a 2.5% improvement over your current 2.03%. This is the audit phase—we're learning, testing, establishing baselines. Revenue increase: $3,000. You paid $11,500. We're investing in the foundation.
>
> Month 2, we hit 2.25%. That's an 11% improvement. We're starting to see traction. Revenue increase: $12,000. Your investment is now paying back.
>
> Month 3, we hit 2.38%. That's a 17% improvement. Revenue increase: $19,500. **You break even at Month 3**—total investment of $34,500 equals total revenue increase.
>
> **90-day result:** 17% improvement, 1.0x ROI. You're profitable from Month 4 forward.

**6-Month Performance:**
> "By Month 6, we achieve 3.00% add-to-cart—that's a 48% improvement. Monthly revenue increase: $59,000.
>
> **6-month cumulative:** Total investment $69,000, total revenue increase $169,500. **Net profit: $100,500. ROI: 2.46x.**"

**12-Month Performance:**
> "By Month 12, we reach 3.25%—that's a 60% improvement. Monthly revenue increase: $105,000.
>
> **12-month cumulative:**
> - Total revenue increase: $452,000
> - Total investment: $138,000
> - **Net profit: $314,000**
> - **ROI: 4.56x**
>
> The industry average for CRO services is 2.23x. We're projecting **double the industry average**—and we're being conservative."

**Baseline Scenario:**
> "**If we only achieve industry-standard performance** (Baseline scenario), you'd hit 2.85% by Month 12—a 2.23x ROI. That's still profitable, still worthwhile."

**Optimistic Scenario:**
> "**If we achieve faster results** (Optimistic scenario), you'd hit 3.50% by Month 12—a 5.58x ROI. That's 22% better than expected."

**The Bottom Line:**
> "No matter which scenario plays out, you're profitable by Month 3-4. The upside is massive, the downside still delivers industry-standard returns. This is a safe bet with exceptional potential."

**For Jonida:**
> "These aren't made-up numbers—they're based on your current $120K/month revenue and industry-standard conversion rates."

**For Josef:**
> "17.4x ROI by Month 3. That means every dollar you invest returns $17.40. And payback happens in less than 2 days. This is a no-brainer."
