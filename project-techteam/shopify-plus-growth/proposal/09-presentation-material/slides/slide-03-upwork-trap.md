## 🎤 Speaking Points

**Opening:**
> "So what went wrong? In March, you hired freelancers from Upwork to handle SEO..."

**Key Messages:**
1. **The Promise:** "Trust me" + graphs showing traffic growth
2. **The Execution:** Bought 1,621 backlinks in March alone (black-hat SEO)
3. **The Strategy:** Focused on B2C content for a B2B business
4. **The Result:** +99% traffic (wrong audience) + -44% conversions

**The Real Damage:**
- 1,621 toxic backlinks = Google penalty risk (could happen any day)
- Wellness seekers driven to site (not bulk buyers)
- Traffic doubled, but conversions crashed
- 8 months wasted = $1.3M in lost opportunity

## 👥 Audience-Specific Positioning

**For Jonida:**
> "You've seen their 'reports'—just email text and images, no real analysis. This is why data-driven strategy matters."

**For Josef:**
> "Those 1,621 backlinks could trigger a Google penalty any day. We need to clean this up immediately while fixing the traffic quality."

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **DO NOT mention "Allen" by name** (the Upwork person)
- Focus on strategy failure, not personal blame
- Position this as a learning moment, not a "you made a mistake" accusation
- Emphasize: "This is fixable—let me show you how"
