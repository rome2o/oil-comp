## 🎤 Speaking Points

**Opening:**
> "Here's the paradox you're living right now..."

**Key Messages:**
- Traffic has DOUBLED since March (99% increase)
- But conversions have CRASHED by nearly half (-44%)
- More visitors = fewer buyers
- This isn't normal—it's a symptom of a fundamental strategy problem
- **We can help you achieve a 60% improvement in 12 months with a 4.56x return on investment**

**Emotional Hook:**
- "You're getting more people to your site, but *fewer* of them are buying."
- "This is costing you a fortune."
- "In 90 days, we can deliver a 17% improvement and break even. In 12 months, you'll see a 60% improvement with industry-leading returns."

## 👥 Audience-Specific Positioning

**For Jonida:**
> "Jonida, you've probably noticed this in the reports—traffic graphs going up, but revenue not matching. This validates what you've been seeing."

**For Josef:**
> "Josef, this means you're paying for traffic that's actively *hurting* your business. We need to fix this fast."
