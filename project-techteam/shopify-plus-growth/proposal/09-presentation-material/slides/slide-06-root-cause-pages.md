## 📊 Visual Elements

**Primary Visual:** Mobile screenshot showing poor UX (before state)

**Left side:** Current product page on mobile
- Shows cramped text
- No trust signals visible
- "Add to Cart" button buried
- No bulk pricing shown

**Right side:** Issues list with icons

**Current Issues:**
- ❌ 85% mobile bounce rate (visitors leave immediately)
- ❌ No trust signals for B2B buyers (missing COAs, certifications)
- ❌ Weak CTAs and unclear bulk pricing
- ❌ No technical specs or formulation guides
- ❌ Product pages designed for B2C retail, not wholesale

**What B2B Buyers Need:**
- ✅ Certificates of Analysis (COAs) for quality assurance
- ✅ Technical specifications for formulation
- ✅ Bulk pricing tiers and volume discounts
- ✅ GMP certifications and third-party testing proof
- ✅ B2B-focused CTAs ("Request Quote" not just "Add to Cart")

## 🎤 Speaking Points

**Opening:**
> "The second root cause: **Your product pages aren't designed for B2B buyers.**"

**The Mobile Problem:**
> "85% of mobile visitors bounce immediately. That's because your pages are optimized for B2C retail customers buying 1-2 bottles, not wholesale buyers purchasing in bulk."

**What's Missing:**
> "B2B buyers need:
> - Certificates of Analysis (COAs) for quality assurance
> - Technical specifications for formulation (if they're making cosmetics or supplements)
> - Bulk pricing tiers (quantity discounts)
> - GMP certifications and third-party testing proof
> - Clear ways to request quotes for large orders"

**The Impact:**
> "Your pages have none of this. So even when you DO attract a qualified buyer, they leave because they don't see what they need to make a purchasing decision."

## 👥 Audience-Specific Positioning

**For Jonida:**
> "This is fixable—we've identified exactly what's missing and how to add it."

**For Josef:**
> "Your competitors are showing COAs and bulk pricing. You're losing deals to them because buyers can't find the information they need on your site."
