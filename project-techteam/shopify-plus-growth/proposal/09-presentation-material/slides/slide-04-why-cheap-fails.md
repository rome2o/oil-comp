## 🎤 Speaking Points

**Opening:**
> "Here's the fundamental difference between cheap freelancers and strategic experts..."

**Key Contrasts:**

**Upwork freelancers:**
- $13/person for keyword research (you get what you pay for)
- Not Shopify specialists—just general SEO
- Bought backlinks instead of earning them (like buying fake reviews)
- Focused on B2C when you're B2B wholesale

**Our approach:**
- Shopify Plus specialists with deep e-commerce expertise
- Data-driven: Every change is A/B tested and validated
- White-hat SEO: Organic authority, no shortcuts
- Commercial keyword targeting: Attract buyers, not browsers

**The Price Difference:**
- $500 LESS per month than current Upwork spend
- But instead of going backwards, you go forward
