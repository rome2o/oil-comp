## 🎤 Speaking Points

**Opening:**
> "Let's talk investment. I've structured three tiers based on speed and scope..."

**Step 1: Present All Three Tiers**
> "Let me walk you through each:
>
> **Starter Tier** ($7,500/month):
> - This is for businesses that want to test the approach first
> - 4-6 product pages optimized per month
> - Timeline: 150 days to hit 3.5% add-to-cart, 18 months to 5.0%
> - Good for cautious investors, but slower results
>
> **Growth Tier** ($11,500/month) ⭐ **RECOMMENDED**:
> - This is the balanced approach—fast results without overspending
> - 8-12 product pages optimized per month
> - Timeline: 90 days to hit 3.5% add-to-cart, 12 months to 5.0%
> - This is what I recommend for your situation
>
> **Plus Tier** ($17,500/month):
> - This is maximum speed—you hit 3.5% add-to-cart in 75 days, 5.0% in 10 months
> - 14-20 product pages optimized per month
> - Best for urgent turnarounds and comprehensive SEO cleanup"

**Step 2: Anchor High (Plus Tier)**
> "Plus Tier is $17,500/month. This is for businesses that need urgent turnarounds—75 days to 3.5%, 10 months to 5.0%."

**Step 3: Recommend Growth**
> "But I don't think you need Plus. What I recommend for your situation is **Growth Tier**—$11,500/month. You get 8-12 product pages optimized per month, 15-20 commercial keywords, weekly calls, and full A/B testing. Timeline is 90 days to 3.5%, 12 months to 5.0%."

**Step 4: Explain Pricing Model**
> "Now, you'll notice—there's no hourly pricing here. You're not buying hours. You're buying outcomes:
>
> - A specific number of product pages optimized each month
> - Comprehensive SEO cleanup with ongoing monitoring
> - B2B landing pages and commercial keyword campaigns
> - Full A/B testing and analytics
>
> That's deliverable-based pricing. It means you know exactly what you're getting, and we're not watching the clock."

**Step 5: Compare to Current Spend** ⚠️ CRITICAL MOMENT
> "Now here's the important part: **You're currently spending $10,000/month on Upwork.** And getting negative results—conversions down 44%.
>
> Growth Tier is $11,500/month. That's **$1,500 more** than you're spending right now. But instead of going backwards, you're moving forward."

**Step 6: Show Contrast (Starter)**
> "Now, if budget is tight, there's Starter Tier at $6,500/month. But here's the trade-off: Starter takes 6 months to hit 5% add-to-cart vs 90 days with Growth. That's 3 extra months of losing $165K/month—a $495K cost to save $3K/month. Plus, you want fast movement—Starter is slow by design."

**Step 7: The Close**
> "So here's what I recommend: **Growth Tier at $9,500/month, with the $2,500 audit waived.** You're getting:
> - $12,000 worth of value for $9,500/month
> - $500/month savings vs your current Upwork spend
> - 90-day timeline to $165K/month additional revenue
> - 17.4x ROI by Month 3
> - Hard hour caps and no long-term lock-in
>
> This is the fastest path to results without overspending. Does this make sense for where you want to take HBNO?"

## 👥 Audience-Specific Positioning

**For Jonida:**
> "Growth Tier is the sweet spot—fast enough to see results in 90 days, affordable enough to justify easily."

**For Josef:**
> "You're already spending $10K/month getting hurt. This is $500 less per month to grow instead of shrink. Plus I'm waiving the $2,500 audit—that's $2,500 you win right there."

## ⚠️ Delivery Notes

**Critical Pause Points:**
1. After saying "Plus Tier is $15,000/month" - let it sink in
2. After saying "Growth Tier normally includes a $2,500 audit fee" - slight pause before reveal
3. After saying "I'm going to waive that $2,500 audit fee" - pause, smile
4. After saying "You're currently spending $10,000/month on Upwork" - let the comparison register

**Tone:**
- Confident (not apologetic about pricing)
- Consultative ("What I recommend...")
- Gift-giving ("I'm going to waive...")
- Matter-of-fact ("$500 less than you're spending now")
