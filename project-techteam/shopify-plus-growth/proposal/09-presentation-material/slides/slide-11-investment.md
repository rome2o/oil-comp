## 🎤 Speaking Points

**Opening:**
> "Let's talk investment. I've structured three tiers based on speed and scope..."

**Step 1: Present All Three Tiers**
> "Let me walk you through each:
>
> **Starter Tier** ($7,500/month):
> - This is for businesses that want to test the approach first
> - 4-6 product pages optimized per month
> - Timeline: 150 days to hit 3.5% add-to-cart, 18 months to 5.0%
> - Good for cautious investors, but slower results
>
> **Growth Tier** ($11,500/month) ⭐ **RECOMMENDED**:
> - This is the balanced approach—fast results without overspending
> - 8-12 product pages optimized per month
> - Timeline: 90 days to hit 3.5% add-to-cart, 12 months to 5.0%
> - This is what I recommend for your situation
>
> **Plus Tier** ($17,500/month):
> - This is maximum speed—you hit 3.5% add-to-cart in 75 days, 5.0% in 10 months
> - 14-20 product pages optimized per month
> - Best for urgent turnarounds and comprehensive SEO cleanup"

**Step 2: Anchor High (Plus Tier)**
> "Plus Tier is $17,500/month. This is for businesses that need urgent turnarounds—75 days to 3.5%, 10 months to 5.0%."

**Step 3: Recommend Growth**
> "But I don't think you need Plus. What I recommend for your situation is **Growth Tier**—$11,500/month. You get 8-12 product pages optimized per month, 15-20 commercial keywords, weekly calls, and full A/B testing. Timeline is 90 days to 3.5%, 12 months to 5.0%."

**Step 4: Explain Pricing Model**
> "Now, you'll notice—there's no hourly pricing here. You're not buying hours. You're buying outcomes:
>
> - A specific number of product pages optimized each month
> - Comprehensive SEO cleanup with ongoing monitoring
> - B2B landing pages and commercial keyword campaigns
> - Full A/B testing and analytics
>
> That's deliverable-based pricing. It means you know exactly what you're getting, and we're not watching the clock."

**Step 5: Compare to Current Spend** ⚠️ CRITICAL MOMENT
> "Now here's the important part: **You're currently spending $10,000/month on Upwork.** And getting negative results—conversions down 44%.
>
> Growth Tier is $11,500/month. That's **$1,500 more** than you're spending right now. But instead of going backwards, you're moving forward."

**Step 6: Show Contrast (Starter)**
> "Now, if budget is tight, there's Starter Tier at $7,500/month. But here's the trade-off: Starter optimizes fewer pages per month (4-6 vs 8-12) and takes longer to reach targets. That's slower progress when you want fast movement."

**Step 7: The Close**
> "So here's what I recommend: **Growth Tier at $11,500/month.** You're getting:
> - 8-12 product pages optimized monthly (deliverable-based, not hour-based)
> - 90-day timeline to 3.5% add-to-cart (+$77K/month additional revenue)
> - 12-month timeline to 5.0% add-to-cart (+$165K/month)
> - 11.9x ROI by 12 months
> - Deliverable-focused scope and no long-term lock-in
>
> This is the fastest path to results with proven deliverables. Does this make sense for where you want to take HBNO?"

## 👥 Audience-Specific Positioning

**For Jonida:**
> "Growth Tier is the sweet spot—realistic timeline to see 3.5% in 90 days and 5.0% in 12 months, with clear deliverables each month."

**For Josef:**
> "You're already spending $10K/month getting hurt. This is $1,500 more per month to grow instead of shrink, with deliverable-based scope so you know exactly what you're getting."
