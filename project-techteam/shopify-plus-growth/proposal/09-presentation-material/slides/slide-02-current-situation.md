## 🎤 Speaking Points

**Opening:**
> "Let's look at your current numbers..."

**Key Messages:**
1. **Volume is good:** 36,000+ visitors/month (traffic isn't the problem)
2. **Add-to-cart is terrible:** Only 2.03% engage with products
3. **Checkout is excellent:** 53% completion rate (no cart abandonment issue)
4. **The bottleneck:** Getting people to engage in the first place

**The Financial Impact:**
- Gap between 2.03% and 8% = $165,000/month
- That's $2 million/year left on the table
- Every single month this continues, you lose $165K
