## 🎤 Speaking Points

**Opening:**
> "Let's look at your current numbers..."

**Key Messages:**
1. **Volume is good:** 36,000+ visitors/month (traffic isn't the problem)
2. **Add-to-cart is terrible:** Only 2.03% engage with products
3. **Checkout is excellent:** 53% completion rate (no cart abandonment issue)
4. **The bottleneck:** Getting people to engage in the first place

**The Financial Impact:**

- 90-day gap (2.03% → 3.5%) = $77,000/month
- 12-month gap (2.03% → 5.0%) = $165,000/month
- That's $1.98 million/year in additional revenue potential
- Every month this problem continues, you're missing out on growth
