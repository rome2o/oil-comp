## 🎤 Speaking Points

**Opening:**
> "Josef, you want fast movement. Here's exactly how fast we can move..."

**The Timeline:**
> "**Sign today.**
>
> Week -1: Contract signed, payment clears in 2-3 days.
>
> Week 0: Onboarding and access setup. We need Shopify admin, Google Analytics, and Search Console access. This takes 3-4 days.
>
> Week 1: We kick off with a 60-minute call, then we execute: B2B keyword analysis, backlink audit, product page audit. You get a full report by Friday.
>
> Week 2: We design wireframes for your optimized product pages. You approve them within 48 hours.
>
> Week 3: We deploy. First optimized product page goes live. B2B landing page launches. A/B tests start running.
>
> Week 4: We measure and report. You see Month 1 results and approve Month 2 plan.
>
> **4 weeks from signature to active optimization. 12 weeks from signature to $165K/month additional revenue.**
>
> That's how we deliver fast movement."

**Time Commitment:**
> "And your time commitment is minimal:
> - Week 1: 60-minute kickoff call
> - Weekly: 30-minute check-ins
> - Design approvals: 1-2 hours (48-hour turnaround)
> - Testing: 30 minutes (make sure nothing broke)
>
> Total: 3-4 hours/week. We handle the heavy lifting, you approve and provide product info."

## 👥 Audience-Specific Positioning

**For Jonida:**
> "Your time commitment is minimal—3-4 hours/week for approvals and calls. We handle the heavy lifting. And you'll have clear progress to report to Josef every week."

**For Josef:**
> "4 weeks to launch. 90 days to results. That's the fast movement you're looking for. No 6-month delays, no endless 'we're working on it'—clear milestones, clear timeline."

## ⚠️ Critical Dependency Callout (on slide)

> **⚠️ Timeline depends on access provisioning**  
> The faster you provide Shopify, Google Analytics, and Search Console access, the faster we launch.  
> Most delays happen here—prioritize this during Week 0.
