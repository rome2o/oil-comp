## 🎤 Speaking Points

**Opening:**
> "I know you've been burned by the Upwork experience. So let me show you how we protect you..."

**Hard Hour Caps:**
> "**Hard hour caps:** Growth Tier is 20 hours/week max. We can't go over without your approval. No surprise bills, no scope creep. You know exactly what you're paying every month."

**Transparent Metrics:**
> "**Transparent metrics:** You'll track add-to-cart rate, traffic quality, revenue, and bounce rate every week. You'll know if it's working. We're not asking you to 'trust us'—we're showing you the data."

**Weekly Reporting:**
> "**Weekly reporting:** Week 1, you get a full audit. Every week after, you get progress updates with screenshots and data. Monthly, you get comprehensive reports. Full transparency—no black box."

**No Lock-In:**
> "**No lock-in:** This is month-to-month. If we're not delivering by Month 2, cancel with 30-day notice. You're out. We earn your business every single month. You're in control."

**A/B Testing:**
> "**A/B testing:** Every change we make is tested. We don't guess—we validate. If it doesn't improve conversions with 95% confidence, we don't keep it. This is data-driven optimization."

**The Contrast:**
> "Compare this to Upwork:
> - They said 'trust me' → We say 'here's the data'
> - They had no caps → We have hard limits
> - They had no reporting → We report weekly
> - They locked you in psychologically → You can cancel anytime
>
> You're protected. The risk is minimal, the upside is massive."

## 👥 Audience-Specific Positioning

**For Jonida:**
> "You'll have full visibility. Weekly updates, transparent metrics, clear reporting. You'll know exactly what's happening and can show Josef progress at any time."

**For Josef:**
> "You can walk away anytime. Month 2 or Month 3, if we're not delivering, cancel with 30 days notice. You're in control. The only way we keep your business is by delivering results."
