## 📊 Visual Elements

**Primary Visual:** Service logo/brand with tagline

**Title:** "Shopify Growth Accelerator"  
**Tagline:** "The Dual-Track Optimization System"

**Two Parallel Tracks (side-by-side columns):**

**Track 1: Traffic Quality**
- Commercial keyword targeting
- B2B content strategy
- Organic authority building
- CTR optimization
- Backlink cleanup (remove Upwork damage)

**Track 2: Product Page Optimization**
- 4-5 pages optimized per month
- Mobile-first UX redesign
- Trust signal implementation (COAs, certifications)
- A/B testing validation
- Conversion rate optimization

**Why Both Tracks Matter (callout box):**
- Better traffic × Better pages = Exponential results
- Fixing only one delivers 50-70% of potential
- Fixing both delivers 130-150%+ revenue increase

**Formula Visual:**
- Fix traffic only: +$77K/month
- Fix pages only: +$87K/month
