## Three Service Tiers, One Core Methodology

All tiers share the same strategic framework and quality standards. The difference is **capacity and frequency**—how many hours per month and how often we engage. Choose based on your current growth stage and internal capacity.

### Why We Recommend Growth Tier for HBNO

Based on your current baseline and recovery needs:

1. **Sufficient Capacity** - 40 hours allows multi-channel work (SEO, conversion, email) simultaneously
2. **Optimal Frequency** - Bi-weekly reviews maintain momentum without overwhelming your team
3. **Balance** - Comprehensive enough for recovery, focused enough for results
4. **Value** - Best effective rate ($72.50/hr) with full-service coordination

Starter tier would extend timeline unnecessarily. Plus tier provides capacity you may not yet fully utilize. Growth hits the efficiency sweet spot.
