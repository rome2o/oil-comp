# Shopify Plus Growth Proposal - Planning Document

**Created:** November 14, 2025  
**Client:** HBNO Essential Natural Oils  
**Focus:** B2B Shopify Plus Growth & Recovery Strategy

---

## Proposal Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. Present realistic assessment of current site health and performance
2. Outline comprehensive recovery and growth strategy
3. Position managed team approach (vs. single-person or agency models)

5. Demonstrate expertise without overselling or guaranteeing outcomes
6. Provide flexible service options with core value propositions

### Key Constraints & Guidelines

- ✅ **B2B focus:** Long sales cycles, lead quality, enterprise buying process
- ✅ **Proactive approach:** Continuous optimization, not reactive
- ✅ **Flexibility:** Adaptable plans with structured core methodology
- ✅ **Managed team:** Multi-disciplinary expertise, not single consultant
- ✅ **Value positioning:** Expertise-based pricing, not commodity hourly rates

### 8. Investment & Value Framework (2-3 pages)
**Purpose:** Frame pricing in context of value and opportunity  

#### Investment Summary
| Tier | Monthly | Annual | Hours | Effective Rate |
|------|---------|--------|-------|----------------|
| Starter | $1,500 | $18,000 | 20 | $75/hr |

| Plus | $4,400 | $52,800 | 60 | $73.33/hr |

#### Value Context
**Compared to:**
- Full-service agencies: $7K-$15K/month (often less focused)

- Freelancers: $50-$150/hour (variable quality, single-discipline)

### 10. Why This Matters Now (1 page)
**Purpose:** Create urgency without pressure tactics  

#### The Cost of Delayed Action
- Every month of low conversion = lost revenue opportunity
- Declining site health compounds recovery time
- Competitors gaining organic search advantage
- Customer acquisition costs increasing in paid channels
- Technical debt accumulating

#### The B2B Context
B2B buying cycles are long (3-18 months typically). The sooner we:
1. Fix technical foundation
2. Improve search visibility
3. Optimize conversion paths
4. Build customer retention systems

...the sooner your business captures buyers early in their research journey.

#### Competitive Positioning
In B2B, organic search credibility = trust. Higher rankings and optimized presence = perceived authority and reliability in your industry.
